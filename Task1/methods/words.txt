Due to the specific nature of its temporal projection (i.e. the
fact it only applies in times of armed conflict), international humanitarian law creates a highly selective legal lens that renders very different
human experiences visible, to those that are made visible by human
rights law. For example, unlike human rights law, international humanitarian law does not generally address many issues taking place in
the domestic sphere, relating to a person’s private life, family relations
and opinions (Fortin, 2017, pp. 58–59). Unlike human rights law, international humanitarian law follows a pragmatic lesser-of-two-evils
logic that allows actions based on military necessity and the killing of
certain individuals on the basis of their status as combatant. It is due to
the profound differences in the projection of these frameworks that the
rules contained by both bodies of law sometimes seem to be in conflict
with each other as a matter of philosophy. It is also probably partly due
to enduring deliberation over these differences that the legal debate
about (i) whether armed groups are bound by human rights law and (ii)
the role of human rights law in these spaces is ongoing.
2.1.3. Same objects and individuals, different legal categories
Several further legal tensions in these spaces are well explained by
the observation by de Sousa Santos that the same social object in a
particular physical space may take on a different legal life, according to
the legal lens that is being applied to it. Indeed, the effect of this phenomenon is particularly profound in international humanitarian law
where objects and individuals are given a legal status that, though
temporally bounded, affects determinations of whether they are protected or can be lawfully made the object of an attack. In the case of
individuals, legal statuses are created and embedded within the law, the
most well-known of these being civilian, combatant, fighter (Fortin &
Heffes, 2023, in press). Yet tensions are sometimes caused by the fact
that the legal statuses created by international humanitarian law, are not
always replicated by domestic law or international human rights law,
where individuals may be considered to have other legal statuses (e.g.
terrorist, citizen, parent, guardian or child) and vice versa. Where there
is dissonance between these legal frameworks, one legal framework
holds potential to undermine another. For example, while it is legal for a
member of an armed group to kill a member of the State’s armed forces,
it is often pointed out that the same act will generally remain a crime
under domestic law. These examples show that individuals and objects
in these spaces are existing in a complex environment of interlegality
where legal rules have a complex co-existence and the lived legal statuses of objects and persons are varied, conflicting and
multidimensional.
2.1.4. Getting down and dirty with everyday life?
The invitation offered by legal cartography to consider whether and
how different frameworks of law connect with the detail of human
experience has similarities with scholarship on international law and
everyday life, which also asks how international norms influence individuals’ lived experience of legal spaces. Elsava and Pahuja have
pointed out the importance of getting "down and dirty"with the
everyday life of international law, in order to see how it takes on productive effect in the materiality of the world (Eslava & Pahuja, 2012).
Because in State controlled territory international (humanitarian law) is
often implemented via domestic law, it is often difficult to evaluate how
and whether international law manifests itself in everyday life in these
spaces (for a recent study however, see (Sutton, 2021)). This is because
very often, particularly in dualist States, international commitments are
– in the words of Eslava – “re-embodied as national or local” via legislation or law (Eslava, 2014, p. 41). Yet in territory under the control of
armed groups, it is widely understood that international humanitarian
law becomes binding upon armed non-State group without the need for
implementing legislation (Fortin, 2017, p. 188; Kleffner, 2011, pp.
446–448; Murray, 2016, p. 112). As a result, the vertical obligations of
an armed group vis-a-vis ` the population under the group’s control in
international humanitarian law are, at least in theory, capable of having
a direct effect on the lived everyday life in these areas. This means that
these norms (i.e. prohibiting murder, taking of hostages etc) are understood, in a doctrinal sense, to be able to come to life (in the sense of
becoming binding and meaningful) in these spaces without there
necessarily being a mediating framework of domestic law implementing
the obligation. Equally, it is pertinent to note that the legal framework
that gives people living in these spaces the status of combatant, fighter,
civilian directly participating in hostilities is very often applied by a
State adversary from the air via their Rules of Engagement. The (theoretical) direct application of international humanitarian law to these
spaces highlights the intense need to study how and whether international humanitarian law really lives in these spaces, in the sense of being
known by (i) the armed group and (i) the population (Fortin, 2021a;
Sutton, 2021).
For a start, it becomes important to enquire whether armed groups
are aware of international humanitarian law. It is for this reason that
organisations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC) and Geneva Call engage with armed groups to increase their
knowledge of international humanitarian law. It also explains why
important studies have been undertaken on the knowledge that armed
groups have of humanitarian norms (Bellal et al., 2022) and the different
actors that affect their compliance (Considerations and Guidance for the
Humanitarian Engagement with Religious Leaders, 2023). Additionally
it is important to make sure that individuals living in the territory are
aware of its basic provisions, especially those which are relevant to their
safety and protection. It is unsettling to read a report that was published
in 2015 and was intended to bring a people’s perspective to debates
regarding the meaning of the term ‘directly participating in hostilities’.
The Centre for Civilians in Armed Conflict (CIVIC) carried out 250 interviews with people who had lived through conflicts in Gaza, Bosnia,
Libya, and Somalia, asking them about civilian involvement in armed
conflict. Its findings showed that many civilians were generally quite
unaware of what actions would cause them to forfeit their civilian immunity and allow them to be targeted. Conducted interviews revealed
many different interpretations of the concept of ‘civilian protection’ that
varied not only by conflict, but also by interviewee (CIVIC, 2015). The
report highlights the danger of civilians existing in a legal universe that
allows them to be identified as target-able (from the air), when they are
not really aware that this legal universe exists (Wilke, 2017, p. 1056).
There is also a problem in a lack of determinacy in the law itself, with
States taking different positions on important legal concepts like direct
participation in hostilities, membership etc. that are relevant to civilian
protection (Haque, 2019; Kinsella, 2011, pp. 187–189). When reflecting
on this situation, one wonders how the international rules on targeting
can be considered part of the blanket of norms said to make up the international rule of law, if there is disagreement on what it says and the
individuals whose protection it determines sometimes do not know it
exists?
The notion of interlegality, which has partly been discussed already,
also invites an understanding of different bodies of law as layered and
interactive. It was explained above that international humanitarian law
is thought to be capable of having direct effect in territory under the
control of armed groups as a matter of legal theory. However, even
though the existence of domestic law may not be necessary for international humanitarian law to become binding upon armed groups in
these spaces, there are instances where the existence of domestic law (of
some kind) is nevertheless required for particular norms of international
humanitarian law to be adhered to by an armed group. This is because
international norms on particular issues implicitly refer to domestic law,
therefore making it an integral layer of the international legal framework. This interrelatedness – which is well captured by the concept of
interlegality - is particularly vividly seen on issues of detention and fair
trial, where international humanitarian law requires an appraisal of
domestic law for a determination of whether trials are fair (nullum
crimen sine lege) or whether detention is arbitrary (Askary & Hosseinnejad, 2019; Heffes, 2022; Jobstl, ¨ 2020; Klamberg, 2018; Provost, 2021;
K. Fortin 
Social Sciences & Humanities Open 8 (2023) 100660
5
Sivakumaran, 2009; Somer, 2007). It is for this reason that a key question that has been asked in scholarship on armed groups and international law is: ‘to what extent can armed group law count as ‘law’ for the
purposes of international law?’ The fact that this question needs to be
asked is illuminative of the way in which international law is capable of
rendering some rules (e.g. armed group law or customary rules) invisible, even though they may be very real on the ground. It provides a
pertinent example of how international law’s scale and projection (to go
back to the metaphor of legal mapping) is able to act as a filter, defining
which rules are internationally significant and which are not, what is
legal and what is not, irrespective of people’s experiences on the ground.
Noticing the existence of these legal filters makes it relevant to
further consider what they may mean to people placed outside the
effective scope of international law’s protections – for example, those
living in gang-controlled communities where the State is absent and
there is no armed conflict, so international humanitarian law does not
apply. It may be easy for international lawyers to declare these zones out
of international humanitarian law’s reach but de Sousa Santos’s theories
on legal cartography– just like Merry and Coutin’s scholarship on
measuring systems (Merry & Coutin, 2014) - encourage us to see that
boundaries contained within international law also play a role in
determining the shape, form and character of what is on the other side.
As Johns points out in her work on non-legality, what is not-legal is often
a central structuring device of international law and thought (Johns,
2013, p. 11). The truth of this argument is seen in Oosterbaan’s
contribution to this Special Issue where he explains how both ‘law-talk’
and ‘absence-of-the-law-talk’ in Rio de Janeiro’s favelas is able to be
instrumentalised for political ends.
2.2. Small scale analytical blinkers and erasing the individual human?
Writings exploring the concept of legal cartography also draw
attention to the dangers of using a small scale map in a conceptual sense
when conducting legal analysis of armed conflict situations. Pearson
reminds us of a need to be alert that international law, international
legal scholars, teachers and practitioners might be ‘complicit’ in the
maintenance of maps or descriptions of the world that privilege only
certain interactions and make others invisible (Pearson, 2008, p. 493).
Similar ideas have been recently discussed by Modirzadeh in her
ground-breaking and much-needed paper on passion in international
humanitarian law (Modirzadeh, 2020). Commenting on the tendency of
scholarship in this field to employ distancing mechanisms when analysing international humanitarian law, Modirzadeh also comments on
the employment of abstraction techniques in the classroom. In doing so,
she verbalises what I suspect many IHL teachers have thought (although
perhaps not even articulated to themselves), and many students of IHL
must have felt. She points out that small-scale, dry, technical talk about
legal hypotheticals involving State A and State B and Armed Group C
may seem to demonstrate a strange “soulless”-ness, when it is considered
that the everyday reality that this scholarship is addressing is nothing
short of a “calamity” (Modirzadeh, 2020, pp. 43–45 and 62). By
sketching out maps on a whiteboard marked with either make-believe or
real countries labelled with letters, divided with lines, coloured with
hatched lines, teachers of IHL become literal legal cartographers – and
perhaps not only on the whiteboard – employing a technical small scale
lens that simplifies, skeletonizes and flattens.
Of course, many IHL teachers take deliberate pains to counter this
tendency by employing innovative teaching methods, such as those
found in the Jean Pictet competition (Sutton & Buis, 2023). But it is
important to acknowledge that some of this abstraction is driven by the
law itself. The fact that international humanitarian law has a threshold
requirement before it will apply explains why any legal analysis must
start from a top-down perspective, that prioritises the identification of
fighting parties before it pays attention to civilian experiences. Similarly, teachers of IHL may feel that they have done their job well when
they have taught students to identify the ‘parties to the conflict’ out of
fragmented pluralities or coalitions, ‘hostilities’ out of generalized
violence; ‘civilians’, ‘combatants’, ‘medical personnel’ out of a mixed
group of individuals. It is in the knowledge this process of identification
is often difficult, that teachers often choose to exclude certain details,
identifying features and emotions when presenting small-scale hypotheticals in the classroom. They are seeking to keep the students’ analysis focused and factual. Moreover, the legal framework itself often
demands the filtering out of these details. The separation between jus ad
bellum and jus in bello requires IHL lawyers to disregard the aims of the
fighting parties, beyond considering whether a conflict fits within
Article 1 (4) of API. The rules on State responsibility – and attribution in
general – require lawyers, in most instances, to disregard the question of
motive. According to these rules, it is the act of the State that matters,
independent of its intention (Responsibility of States for Internationally
Wrongful Acts, 2001, Article 2, para 10 of commentary). As Marks
writes, lawyers "tend to be deeply interested in ‘how’ questions (not to
mention ‘what’, ‘where’, ‘when’ and some ‘who’ and ‘whom’ questions),
but [are] distinctly reserved when it comes to ‘why’ questions" (Marks,
2009, p. 15). This tendency – which de Sousa Santos would likely call a
scaling technique – is often thought important, and necessary, to secure
due focus on the legal issues at hand and exclude unnecessary details.
Yet, it should not be forgotten that the “specialised language that international lawyers speak” has a constitutive effect on the way others see
and understand armed conflict (Reynolds, 2019, p. 158 and169; Said,
1996, pp. 85–86).
This reflection points to the need to be cognisant of the analytical
blinkers that accompany small scale legal frameworks and be alert to
their tendency to strip out the everyday life and individual experience
from the analysis. Indeed, it is especially relevant to be alert to this
danger, considering concurrent factual developments are also threatening to make the details of everyday life on the ground more remote for
those tasked with applying the legal framework to it. With the rise of
technology, unmanned aerial vehicles are able to kill increasingly
remotely. Writing nearly twenty years ago, Gregory argued that the
visual technology of late modern warfare produces the “space of the
enemy as an abstract space on an electronic screen of coordinates and
pixels” (Gregory, 2006, p. 94). He argued that high-level abstractions
contribute to a “discourse of objectivity”, so that “bombs and missiles
rain down on K-A-B-U-L but not on Kabul” (Gregory, 2006, p. 94). He
argued that news media and video games contribute to what he terms an
"erasure of corporality" so that the public becomes accustomed to understanding ‘“alien cities as targets: their people, their neighbourhoods,
all the mundane geographies of everyday life hollowed out’ (Gregory,
2006, p. 95). More recently, Wilke recalls how the Germany parliamentary committee conducting an investigation a NATO drone strike
that killed between 50 and 179 people, demonstrated a strong preference for the report based on the images relayed by aerial cameras, as
interpreted by the pilots and differently situated ground control officers
and was “very critical” of the report compiled on the basis of interviews
with local people, finding it not to be “scientific” enough (Wilke, 2017,
p. 1053). The parliamentary committee apparently distrusted local
voices on the basis that they felt that they were unlikely to admit Taliban
affiliation and also found that there are no objective criteria for assessing
the victims’ civilian or combatant status. As a result, the “everyday
experience” was essentially “vacated and displaced” by the committee,
in favour of the distanced, high altitude, objective account created by
technology from which the human voice was erased (Wilke, 2017, p.
1054). This shows that there are multiple forces beyond law contributing to a generalized abstraction of these spaces and underline the
heightened need to be alert to this development.
3. Conclusions
While the analysis contained in this article certainly does not answer
all the questions that were asked in the context of this project, it has been
inspired by them. The article reflects on the way in which many
K. Fortin

international lawyers tend to think about rules and laws in territory
under the control of armed groups and armed conflict more generally. de
Sousa Santos’s writing on legal cartography understands legal frameworks as interactional and multidimensional, with each framework
having a different projection, centre and purpose. It invites a study of
how these different legal frameworks independently and collectively
render different legal rules, objects, relationships and details visible and
relevant and likewise may hide or render irrelevant or invisible others.
Assessing the extent to which international law is capable of penetrating
the everyday and interacting with other frameworks (somewhat) guards
against studying international law as an exterior phenomenon (Pearson,
2008, p. 6), removed from the messiness of everyday life. Instead, it
invites and encourages a study of how and when international law
connects with – and even constitutes - everyday life and human existence in these spaces. Perhaps most importantly it warns against
creating a classroom or field of scholarship where the study of law and
rules becomes so technical, that it seems divorced from the everyday
experiences of people suffering on the ground. Indeed, the article’s most
important message is that care is needed to ensure that the small scale
international legal frameworks that are most often applied to armed
conflict do not become so skeletonized that they no longer take account
of the human experience of conflict. It is important to remember that
when Lauterpacht talked about the individual being the base unit of
international law, it was unlikely that he was referring to the politician,
the statesperson, or the international lawyer – but meant instead the
ordinary individual who is very often the most important conduit of
legal rules, whether they be obligations or rights (Lauterpacht, 1950, p.
69).
With thanks to the insightful comments of the peer reviewers of this
article. I am also grateful for the comments provided by the other editors
of the special issue and the helpful feedback and suggestions given by
Lorena Sosa, Jessica Dorsey, Rebecca Sutton, Ezequiel Heffes and Lauren
Gould. This article has been written as part of the author’s NWO Veni
project entitled Dangerous Liaisons: Armed Groups, Civilian Agency and
International Law (File no. VI. Veni.191 R.051). In this article I address the mining frontier as a context where
different sets of laws and standards come together, clash, and are
negotiated. Extractive projects bring together a variety of actors with
different and sometimes opposing interests and worldviews (Buur et al.,
2019; Pijpers & Eriksen, 2018: 1–2; Taylor & Menzies, 2012: 229). These
form novel configurations in which existing regimes of control over
resources, territory and populations are suspended and make way for
new ones (Rasmussen & Lund, 2018). Such contexts are often referred to
as “frontiers” that have the connotation of massive investments and
grand opportunities, but also of social disruption, human rights violations, environmental degradation, and neo-colonization. The resource
frontier has been described as wild, violent, and deregulated (Li, 2010;
Tsing, 2005: 27–28). However, rather than lawless and unregulated,
ethnographic research reveals governance constellations at the resource
frontier to be “thick” and observes a “plurification” of regulatory authorities, albeit an uneven and patchy one (Cote ˆ & Korf, 2018; Watts,
2018). The mining frontier thus emerges as a sociospatial phenomenon
where many rules, orders, and governance regimes collide often in new
ways (Larsen, 2015: 5; Rasmussen & Lund, 2018: 387). Frontiers are
“complex plural constellations” (von Benda-Beckmann & Turner, 2018:
257) (e.g., Standards of the International Finance Corporation, state
mining law and resettlement regulation, land law, human rights law)
and a variety of actors (e.g., mining companies, international finance
institutes, government agencies, local populations, NGOs).
Laws and standards play an important role in extractive projects
because they define who has the rights to resources, who benefits from
the resources, and how compensation, grievances, and protest are dealt
with (Taylor & Menzies, 2012). Extractive projects often bring (expectations of) economic growth, jobs, and connections between local
businesses and the global economy, but they are also inherently
conflictual and often infringe the rights of local populations (Buur et al.,
2019). Therefore, it is pertinent to understand how different sets of laws
and standards relate to one another in the context of a mining frontier.
How and when do certain sets of standards and laws apply? How are
they interpreted and implemented? Who is involved in their implementation? What kinds of hierarchies of laws and standards emerge in a

context characterized by institutional patchiness? In this context of
“complex plural constellations” (Benda-Beckmann & Turner, 2020: 22)
made up out of diverse regulations, who and what ultimately shape
which laws and standards are implemented? And how does this shape
the lives of those who are affected by the mining frontier?
This article takes up these questions in relation to the process of
planned displacement caused by coal mining projects in Tete province,
Mozambique. Large-scale investments for mining (and other) projects
often require the dispossession and dislocation of people from their land
and homes, a process that in Mozambique is referred to as “involuntary
resettlement.” This is involuntary because in the name of national interests the government can prioritize subsoil exploration over other
types of land use. In Mozambique resettlement is associated with human
rights violations and the increasing impoverishment of often already
vulnerable people (Human Rights Watch, 2013; Lesutis, 2022; Lillywhite et al., 2015; Mosca & Selemane, 2011; see also Owen & Kemp,
2015). Buur et al. (2019) have argued that more inclusive economic
transformations would involve a delicate balance between implementing investment and accommodating the rights of local populations. This
legal landscape is however a complex one as it is characterized by
different sets of laws and regulations that relate to different actors and
work on different scales. Resettlement processes in particular draw on
national laws, international standards (which I regard in this paper as a
form of “soft law”), and corporate policies among others. Resettlement
processes thus form an example of a practice that exists in the context of
regulatory plurification of the extractive frontier. In Mozambique, such
processes unfold in a context that is already characterized by multifaceted modalities of governance and multiple jurisdictions and involves
various sets of governance actors (Obarrio, 2014). Mining-induced
resettlement in Mozambique is planned and managed by extractive
companies, but also involves government agencies, finance institutions,
companies in the supply chain, local populations, national and international civil society organisations, and many more. These actors often
draw on different regulatory traditions with different views on rights,
responsibilities, and processes (see also Taylor & Menzies, 2012: 229).
In this article I will explore how different sets of laws and standards
that shape resettlement processes relate to one another by zooming in on
a crucial actor in resettlement processes: resettlement officers of
extractive companies. I opt for the terminology resettlement officer,
which is a profession that is also referred to as community relations
officer or social assessment and impact manager. Resettlement officers
find themselves typically in relation to actors with divergent interests,
such as mining companies, government officials, and local populations.
These interests also reflect in how resettlement managers relate to and
navigate different sets of laws and standards, and how they translate
these into plans and practices. I will show that in the context of the coal
mines in Tete, the hierarchies of laws and standards are not fixed and
that their implementation depends highly on the nature of a particular
coal mining company and is determined by the reluctance or incapacity
of the state to enforce laws. In this context, international standards and
voluntary corporate guidelines often result as more important points of
reference than the ‘hard laws’ of the state. Resettlement officers are at
the forefront of implementing resettlement and thus in choosing directions in what rules and laws are important points of references and
which are less so. By focusing on resettlement officers, we can explore
one of the ways by which corporations act as governing actors at the
extractive frontier.
I draw on fieldwork conducted between 2016 and 2019 in the surroundings of coal mines in Moatize, a district in Tete province, where
since 2011 large-scale mining-induced resettlements took place. Given
that coal resources in Moatize are located in relatively densely populated areas, residents needed to be relocated to areas away from the
mining site to prevent them from suffering the most direct and harmful
effects of coal mining. The research included interviews with resettlement officers of various extractive companies in Mozambique. I
accompanied four resettlement officers in their daily work in Tete and
Maputo, and I participated in a two-week course on land acquisition and
resettlement taught in Maputo and that is generally followed by resettlement officers. In addition, I conducted fieldwork in different resettlement areas, and I did interviews with activists, NGO staff, as well as
government officials.
The paper is structured as follows: I will start by giving an overview
of the most important sets of laws and standards related to resettlement
processes. Subsequently, I will introduce the resettlement officers and
the context of Tete. Then I will provide an ethnographic exploration of
how resettlement officers relate to different sets of rules and laws and
how these result in the implementation of resettlement processes.
2. Rules, laws, and standards of resettlement
The plural legal constellations that shape resettlement processes in
Mozambique have roots in colonialism and reflect global connections
shaped by multinational companies as well as development cooperation
and human rights discourses (von Benda-Beckmann & Turner, 2018).
The regulation of resettlement processes in Mozambique is a complex
meshwork of sets of standards and laws that work on different scales and
involve different actors. For the sake of clarity, in this paper I make a
rough three-way division between 1) national law and regulations, 2)
international soft law related to corporations, and 3) human rights law. I
will now briefly introduce these three sets of regulations.
First, in legal terms, one could say resettlement starts with eminent
domain – the power of the state actor to take private property for public
use under certain circumstances in the name of national interest (Buur
et al., 2019). The constitution of Mozambique states that people have
the right to equitable compensation for expropriated assets and the right
to a new and equal plot of land. The resettlement process is thus part of
the compensation for expropriation. In the context of international investment projects, the government of Mozambique plays the role of an
arbiter. According to the Art.30 of the Mozambican Mining Law, the
government oversees the exchange deals made between the investors, in
this case coal mining companies, and the people to be resettled. The
government is also in charge of settling any occurring disputes. Consequently, one of the main tasks of the government is the provision and
enforcement of laws and regulations concerning resettlement. One of the
main legal instruments for resettlement is the regulation for resettlement
resulting from economic activities, Decree nr. 31/2012 of 8 August
2012, and a new mining law, approved in 2014 (Law no. 20/2014 of 18
August). This regulation and the revised mining law were developed
after criticism by civil society organisations of initial resettlement processes by the coal mining company Vale in 2009. These laws and regulations were formulated in consultation and negotiation with corporate
actors, the World Bank, and international donors, among others (Schubert, 2020: 552–553; Wiegink, 2020). This is not exceptional in
Mozambique, as Obarrio (2014) shows, juridical reform in post-colonial
Mozambique is generally shaped by foreign agencies. The Mozambican
legal framework concerning project-induced resettlement is perceived
as progressive and there are indications of strengthened audit regimes
and improved efficiency in the governing of the extractive industry
(Schubert, 2020: 552–553). The resettlement regulation for instance
stipulates that companies are obliged to conduct community consultation before the beginning of the mining operations and to provide for fair
and transparent compensation for affected households when mining
activities implies resettlement. Under this regulation, the government
can fine companies or withdraw mining licenses if relocation happens
without observing communities’ social and economic interests. However, illustrated by the widely reported flaws of the resettlement processes in Tete (Lesutis, 2019a,b; Lillywhite et al., 2015), the poor
implementation and lack of enforcement of these legal provisions has
been a stumbling block for a more effective protection of people’s rights.
Second, resettlement is further regulated by different sets of standards that can be described as “soft law”, which refers to non-binding
instruments, for example declarations, environment and social
N. Wiegink 
Social Sciences & Humanities Open 8 (2023) 100659
3
standards, and codes of corporate conduct (Blackett, 2001: 402; Sandvik, 2011; Zerilli, 2010). Such initiatives have proliferated in recent
decades and more and more companies subscribe to such “soft standards” and, increasingly, sustainable development principles (Rajak,
2020). The most important standards for mining-induced resettlement
are the performance standards of the International Finance Corporation
(IFC) of the World Bank Group, which refers to land acquisition and
involuntary resettlement, and the standards of the International Council
on Mining and Metals (ICMM). The IFC standards are seen as having
“serious teeth” as complying with these standards or not may make the
differences between obtaining a loan or equity finance or not (Addison &
Roe, 2018). The industry organisation ICMM is specifically relevant for
mining companies, as it aims to guarantee safe and fair mining through a
set of Mining Principles that members are expected to adopt. One of the
first mining companies that operated in Tete, Rio Tinto, was a founding
member of the ICMM. Vale re-joined the ICMM in 2017. Such guiding
principles are voluntary and can be regarded as part of a global system of
ethical governance that naturalizes the role of corporations in development efforts and strengthens corporate power (Dolan & Rajak, 2016).
Third, resettlement processes are also potentially considered a
human rights issue, as the impact of relocation of people often has
adverse effects on livelihood means, access to water, and much more.
The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UN, 2011)
involves a commitment to avoid, mitigate, and remedy negative impacts
on human rights caused or related by activity of a business project (Van
der Ploeg & Vanclay, 2017). The proliferation of human rights in business practices and standards is immense, but this is still largely a
voluntary commitment (ibid.). While (some) companies (often
backed-up by donors) present themselves as champions for human
rights, the human rights record of project-induced resettlement is a
rather bleak one, also in Mozambique. The dire living conditions in the
resettlement areas of Mualadzi and Cateme in Tete province have been
covered in various reports by international organisations such as Human
Rights Watch (2013) and Oxfam (Lillywhite et al., 2015) and national
organisations such as the Human Rights League, Centro Terra Viva,
Observatorio Meio Rural, Justiça Ambiental, and CIP. Reported human
rights violations include loss of livelihood activities, such as farming,
fishing, and selling stones or charcoal; an insecure supply of water; the
lack of participation in decision making processes; lack of information
and documentation; and a repressive attitude of the government, especially when resettled people voiced their discontent (Human Rights
Watch, 2013; Lillywhite et al., 2015; Mosca & Selemane, 2011; Sitoe &
Queface, 2015). The national Human Rights League has brought several
cases to court in Mozambique. But court cases have dragged on and have
not resulted in additional compensation for people affected by resettlement or in substantial sanctions for mining companies.
All of these sets of hard and soft laws apply to the resettlement
context or, one could argue, should apply. Yet these sets of laws are
differently applied, enforced, and understood across resettlement projects in Mozambique. To understand how and when certain sets of hard
or soft law become relevant and how these different sets relate to one
another, I will zoom in on the work of resettlement officers in the coal
mining area in Tete and how they navigate these plural legal constellations in relation to resettlement projects.
3. The in-betweenness of the resettlement officer
Resettlement officers generally oversee the design and implementation of resettlement projects. Project-induced resettlement in
Mozambique has significantly increased since the 2000s when the
government of Mozambique centralized extractive projects as the principal vehicle for developing the country. The development of the coal
mines in Tete was the first big extractive endeavour and involved the
resettlement of over 10,000 people between 2009 and 2014 alone
(Lesutis, 2019a,b). In this paper I focus on the resettlement officers who
worked in Tete for the mining companies Vale and ICVL.
The Brazilian mining company Vale was the first to start coal production in 2009 as it acquired the Moatize concession and developed the
Nacala Logistic Corridor (NLC), which includes a railway that runs from
Moatize through Malawi to the coal terminal at the deep waters of
Nacala port. The second largest coal concession, the Benga mine, was
initially explored by the junior mining company Riversdale, which was
acquired by Rio Tinto, a British-Australian mining company. Rio Tinto’s
mining operation in Mozambique was short-lived as in 2014 the company sold its assets to the Indian consortium International Coal Venture
Limited (ICVL) consisting of predominantly state-owned companies.
These companies were responsible for the building of the two biggest
resettlement villages, Cateme and Mualadzi, located about 40 km from
Moatize town. At the time of fieldwork, relocation to these villages was
largely completed, and the resettlement efforts primarily addressed the
restoration of the inhabitants’ livelihoods. This was the main task of the
resettlement officers who I encountered during fieldwork.
“The company does not want to spend too much money, the communities are never satisfied, and the government wants to get something
out of this, this is so stressful.” These are the words of Ibrahimo (a
pseudonym), a resettlement officer for one of the coal mining companies
in Tete. His job was to negotiate and implement resettlement processes.
His words summarized the way in which resettlement officers for
extractive companies in Mozambique generally characterized their position: as balancing interests of a variety of actors that include the state
(often a variety of state agencies), the mining company, the people
affected by resettlement, and civil society organisations. Resettlement
officers have the delicate job of changing people’s lives profoundly,
while also—among other things—keeping within the company’s budget
and timelines. They are in the forefront of ensuring a company’s “social
license to operate” and they oversee implementing Corporate Social
Responsibility (CSR) projects. Consequently, they must manage relationships with government agencies, local communities, subcontracted companies such as consultancy firms and other relevant actors. This happens in a particular political context, which in
Mozambique is characterized by a dominant but often distant governing
elite mainly made up by the Frelimo party, of which many members
have great interests in the extractive industry (Macuane, Buur, &
Monjane, 2018). In addition, resettlement processes, and the work of
resettlement officers, are shaped by shifting global commodity markets,
local conflicts, and the scrutiny from watchdog organisations to name
just a few contextual factors.
The resettlement officers of the coal mining companies in Tete were
generally Mozambican. They were often in their 30s or 40s, most of
them were men, and most of them had university degrees in social sciences or law. They typically worked in a team consisting of higheducated officers from Maputo and more junior local officers with the
ability to speak the local language. The more senior officers I spoke to
were part of Maputo’s middle class, often educated or trained abroad. In
some cases, their education was paid for by mining companies. The officers resembled in several ways the “mediating bureaucrats” described
by Buur and Nystrand (2020). They use this notion to characterize the
position of high-level directors in the sugar industry of Mozambique,
who move between different constellations of public and private office,
including different positions in the Frelimo party and government (Buur
and Nystrand, 2020). Similarly, senior resettlement officers in Tete have
often been employed as assessors in government ministries or were so
after having worked in the extractive industry. Consequently, the
resettlement officers I encountered were well situated to navigate between different social realms, and to employ different rules and “tacit
codes” (Blundo & Olivier de Sardan, 2006). These included different sets
of national laws and company standards, but also the less formal ways of
engaging with for example government officials. These navigations of
resettlement officers were however constrained by the nature of the
mining company and global and local developments in the extractive
industry.

4. “The Indian is complicated”1
How global commodity markets and the nature of mining companies
shape resettlement practices is well illustrated by the predicament of
resettlement officers working for ICVL, the Indian consortium that took
over the mining concession of Rio Tinto. Ibrahimo, who I introduced
previously, was one of the senior resettlement officers of ICVL. Although
Mozambican, he was schooled in South Africa and gained most of his
working experience with Rio Tinto. He had fond memories of that
period. In one of our conversations, he reminisced nostalgically that “Rio
Tinto was a great school for me. They worked with the highest international standards. We had a great livelihood program, developed by
KPMG.2 That is the best, internationally. So, we were really working
well.” In Ibrahimo’s view, ICVL compared rather poorly to Rio Tinto and
resulted as “complicated.” As ICVL took over the Benga concession in
2014, coal prices were very low and soon ICVL paused its coal production. For years, the community relations office of ICVL did not receive
extra funding, the salaries of Ibrahimo and other Mozambican employees were paid but frozen, and their health care insurance was
stopped. The resettlement managers discontinued their regular visits to
the resettlement area of Moatize because they had no funding to fulfil
the demands of the residents. The resettlement process which already
had been flawed according to Oxfam (Lillywhite et al., 2015) and other
organisations, started to crumble further.
The change in ownership of the mining concession was also noticed
in the resettlement village Mualadzi and relationships between the local
population and the company were quite sour when I conducted fieldwork between 2016 and 2018. “We have never seen the Indian”, several
residents of Mualadzi said to me. They wondered where the resettlement
funds went, and rumours circulated about Ibrahimo and other resettlement officers “eating” the resettlement benefits. This situation put the
resettlement officers in a very tight spot. They were criticised by the
residents of the resettlement area for not living up to the company
promises. At the same time, they were not receiving any back-up from
the company, which kept them on a pay roll but allocated no resources
to the resettlement process. In other words, ICVL was not accommodating the rights of the population affected by the mine.
Resettlement officers are involved in a realm of activities that are
often not the priority issue for extractive companies. The mitigation of
social impact of extractive projects usually costs more time and money
than initially planned for (Owen & Kemp, 2015). However, most of the
resettlement officers that I spoke with considered their work as central
for the business of the company. They made the so-called “business case”
for good community relations, as conflict and protests of people in the
surroundings of the project result in delays and in more costs in terms of
money, time, resources, and often company reputation. To illustrate
this, many resettlement officers in Tete recalled the protests in 2012,
when residents of Cateme blocked the railway that passed their village
and thereby stopped Vale’s coal production for several days. With this
example resettlement managers argued that “bad” resettlement is bad
for business. This logic is repeated in scholarship about “soft” security
measures in the surroundings of extractive companies that are considered to be part of the business practices of mining companies (e.g., Buur
& Sumich, 2019; Honke, ¨ 2013). In addition, the business case for good
community relations is widely used in the resettlement consultancy
literature and supported by World Bank and donors’ hopes that resettlement will result in opportunities for sustainable development (Reddy
et al., 2015). However, companies relate in different ways to the “sustainable development” paradigm and to CSR standards. In addition, for
some company’s CSR reputation seems to be more important than for
others. In Ibrahimo’s view, ICVL did not care as much as other companies operating in Mozambique did and this was exemplified in the
company’s decision to pause resettlement activities when the company
faced dropping coal prices and temporarily stopped mining operations.
This had no legal consequences and left Ibrahimo and his colleagues
with nothing much to do than to wait and stall the resettlement process
until coal production would pick up again.
5. “There is no control”
The resettlement officers that I spoke to in Tete, thought it was the
job of the Mozambican government to address misconduct of mining
companies and to monitor whether national laws and regulations were
followed. These expectations became particularly apparent when the
resettlement officers reflected on the challenges they faced with
involving government actors in resettlement processes.
On a day in May 2017, I accompanied two Mozambican resettlement
officers of Nacala Logistics Corridor (Corredor Logistico Integrado de
Nacala, CLN), a joint venture of mining company Vale and the state
company Mozambique Ports and Railways (Portes e Caminhos de Ferro de
Moçambique, CFM). The Nacala Corridor project was for eighty per cent
owned by Vale. It entails a 900 km-long railway to transport coal to the
port of Nacala. While parts of the railway were pre-existing, 230 km of
the railway needed to be constructed anew between 2011 and 2014,
which resulted in the resettlement of 1817 households and affected
12,000 households economically as the railway passed through their
farmland.3
I joined the two resettlement officers on a visit of communities
affected by the railway infrastructure in Moatize district. We drove
along the railway north of the town of Moatize almost up to the border
with Malawi. The dry, hilly bushland was populated with sporadic villages and homesteads. The flag of Renamo (the National Resistance of
Mozambique, Resistˆencia Nacional de Moçambique), an armed group and
the main opposition party of Mozambique, was flying in several settlements. This was a remarkable sight as open support of for Renamo was in
many parts of Tete considered dangerous. Between 2012 and 2016,
Renamo combatants and government security forces were engaged in an
armed conflict which mainly impacted central Mozambique, including
Moatize district. While at the time of fieldwork in 2017 hostilities had
ended, politically the relations between the two parties were very tense.
I made a remark about the Renamo flags and the CLN resettlement
officers confirmed that this was an area with much support for Renamo.
“People at the bottom do not like those at the top,” one of them said,
adding that “the government hardly shows its face here. There is nothing
here. No jobs, no health posts. There is nothing to find here.” From this
the conversation moved naturally to what the (seemingly) absence of the
government meant in relation to the mining projects. One of the resettlement officers who I will call Marco, explained that:
There is very little control in this area. And if they [government officials] accompany you to communities we need to pay them. I am
talking about the directors and technicos [of the government]. Do you
remember the payments I made yesterday? That were payments to
the technical guys of the government - their per diem. But they might
also simply say, ‘I have no time, I have other work to do.’ That is not
1 This is a quote from a resettlement officer that resonates with other remarks
made by Mozambican interlocutors in reference to extractive enterprises from
Indian origin. This merits further analysis of the (racial) hierarchies and a
general reflection on “postcolonial meanings attributed to whiteness, including
expertise, technology, power, money, hard work, meritocracy, and philanthropy” (Appel, 2019: 28) in Mozambique’s extractive context that go beyond
the scope of this paper. 2 KPMG is one of the world’s biggest international accountant and consultancy firms providing audit, tax, and advisory services.

right. It is their job to control. But here there is no control. And if they
send someone for an audit, they have no idea. They send sociologists
that just come from university and who have no idea what to ask. The
government just wants to know something when they need money,
and then these per diems come in handy.
From the perspective of these resettlement officers, the government
was absent and failed to provide for the local populations in the rural
parts of Moatize. In their view, government officials failed in controlling
or auditing the mining companies, and merely profited from the mining
companies when it suited them. Per diems were an essential means for
resettlement officers to involve government actors, however not in a
meaningful way.4 The resettlement officers considered their work with
the comunidades, including the compensation offered for resettlement
and the community projects they implemented, to be solely at the
initiative of Vale or in this case CNL.
Another resettlement officer of Vale expressed a similar analysis:
“The norms of CSR are very beautiful. But the government does not have
the capacity to comply with this law [and] to call on the companies to
submit their CSR plans. This you cannot leave up to the liberty of the
companies. […] It is already something if the companies [make a CSR
plan], all alone, without being obliged by no one, if they remember
this.”5 This resettlement officer painted a picture of an absent government and a very willing company that complied with all the norms and
did even more than was demanded of them by national law. He alludes
here to the “soft laws” and standard settings of companies and international bodies such as the EITI that introduce voluntary standards.
Compliance with such standards is often expected from investors,
shareholders, and other actors. In such a context international standards
and expectations are higher than domestic requirements (Tagliarino,
2016).
Similarly, CSR efforts were also understood in terms of exchanges
between the company and the government. During our trip along the
railway, Marco pointed out a village where he and his colleagues
planned to dig three boreholes. “But these will be on the record of the
government.” Why is the government not drilling the boreholes themselves? I asked. Marco answered that the government does not have the
funds, “so we do it for them.” He shrugged, to him this was one of the
several ways in which their social projects merged with the interests of
the district government. But this is also one of the many ways in which
corporate actors take up governance tasks (see von Benda-Beckmann
et al., 2009) or in this case strengthen the government, which in
Mozambique also means strengthening the party in power, Frelimo.
While Mozambique’s expropriation and resettlement laws are
regarded as quite comprehensive, the implementation of this legislation
has been slow, and the capacity of state actors to enforce the law is
considered weak (LANDac, 2016). The resettlement officer of Vale also
mentioned that the government of Mozambique does not “oblige”
companies to follow certain laws and standards. He worked for six years
in the mining industry and observed that the mining companies have
only minimally been held accountable by the government for malpractices, a process that is further complicated by the alleged corruption of
courts. In this context, following regulations and standards is largely up
to individual companies, and, as we will see in the next section, their
critics. This does not mean that resettlement officers do not engage with
state actors. Yet in their experience these engagements were not shaped
by the laws and regulations that govern project inducted resettlement.
Zooming in on the everyday practices of resettlement officers, we see
that the relationships with state actors were shaped by relationships of
exchange. This is illustrated for instance by the handing out of per diems
to “technical guys” of the government.
While the Mozambican government at some level can be considered
as an arbiter that sets laws, allocates concessions, and approves resettlement plans, among other things (Bainton & Skrzypek, 2021; Rigi,
2007), resettlement officers operate in a space where the state is not
(perceived as) acting as a regulatory or controlling body. Rather, the
state-company relationships that resettlement officers are managing are
shaped by dynamics of exchange and politics. Within such relationships
resettlement officers mediate the diverse interests of the state, the party,
and companies and “liaise between business and political interests,
technical and technocratic concerns, and administrative and legal procedures” (see Buur & Nystrand, 2020: 343). Which CSR guidelines and
regulations are followed and to what extent, are thus the results of a
translation of these interests.
6. “It seems like no one sees this”
In addition to state actors, civil society organisations, including
watchdog organisations and (environmental) NGOs, were another actor
that shaped how resettlement officers navigated and understood the
implementation of laws and regulations surrounding mining and
resettlement.
On my trip with Marco, the resettlement officer working for the CNL
railway, we passed the dry port of Jindal Africa, an Indian coal mining
company. It was a big terrain on the fringes of a populous neighbourhood of Moatize town. There was a row of train freights loaded with
coal, prepared to be taken by railway to the Nacala sea port. On top of
one of the freights, someone was shovelling the coal from one side of the
freight to another. Marco was shocked. “This would have never been
possible within Vale”, he said, and pointed out that “the guy does not
even wear a mask.” In the Vale mine and in the CNL offices the work of
loading coal freights is automated and strict health and safety regulations are in place and followed, as I had come to experience while
travelling with Marco. Upon entering the CNL offices I was first shown a
video that instructed the viewer on the values and health and safety
rules of Vale. Marco dutifully reminded me to put my seatbelt on every
time we entered the car and in the courtyard of his office told me not to
enter the freight garage wearing my sandals as people were obliged to
wear fortified boots and a helmet in that area.
Marco moved his attention from the shovelling man to the surroundings. He pointed out the trees and the houses adjacent to the dry
port of Jindal that were all covered in black coal dust. “This should not
be this way. But there is no one who says anything. The government does
not, and neither does civil society. I do not understand this. They [civil
society organisations] only focus their attention on some companies,
such as Vale. They never say anything about Jindal and ICVL. They do
not care.” To stress that Vale did “care”, Marco told me about the audits
that Vale is subject to. Fortunately, he said it is not the government that
does this, but the World Bank and IFC. “But I wonder if these other
companies do such audits”, he added. “These are voluntary.” His words
rang with a certain pride for working for Vale, a company that was
following “the rules” and was working in his view up to standard.
Why then is Vale investing so much in social impact mitigation, I
asked. Marco said: “Because it has a name to protect. They do not need
reputation damage. A company like Jindal does not care. If we would do
the same things. Our gates would be closed. People would be protesting.
But Jindal …, it seems like no one sees this.” Marco referred to past
protests of reassentados in Moatize, but also suggested that NGOs and
watchdog organisations keep a close eye on Vale. Due to previous
malpractices elsewhere (Marshall, 2015), Vale has been closely scrutinized by various NGOs and human rights organisations in Mozambique
(Human Rights Watch, 2013; Lillywhite et al., 2015) and by international organisations such as the global activist organisation, People
Affected by Vale (Atingidos pela Vale). To Marco it felt unfair that Vale
4 Per diems are often-generous payments for participation in workshops or
activities organized by companies or NGOs. Such allowances are considered as
much-needed salary augmentations and are generally seen as a way to
distribute resources to the government, but also allow for personal patronage
dynamics and the hollowing out of state organisations (Pfeiffer, 2003). 5 Interview: 20 March 2017.

received so much criticism in Mozambique, while many other companies could do as they pleased and get away with this. The standards
that NGOs and international organisations applied when assessing the
human rights record in the extractive industry thus seem to differ per
company and are shaped by past histories and the nature and provenance of a company (Kirsch, 2014; Salverda, 2019).6 Some companies,
such as Vale, may go beyond national law and standards and provide
more resources to CSR projects or resettlement efforts (see also Li,
2016). Other companies seem to have less concerns about company
reputation, such as Jindal. Such differences directed the companies’
allocation of resources and personnel to resettlement processes and thus
influenced the daily work of the resettlement officers, including the
extent to which this was in concurrence with the soft and hard laws
relating to resettlement.
In 2015, Jindal was accused by civil society organisations for noncompliance to their resettlement plan. About 300 households had
been waiting for six years for resettlement, while the company enclosed
their homes within the fence of the mine and started mining operations
in their vicinity. The court acknowledged the non-compliance of the
company and ruled in favour of the plaintiffs, yet there was no further
action taken to commence the resettlement process, nor was the company sanctioned. In 2020, Justiça Ambiental and Friends of the Earth
called the company’s way of operating a “classic example of corporate
impunity.”

7. Final reflections
In August 2019 I followed a two-week course on resettlement,
together with about thirty resettlement officers and other kinds of
consultants (to be). One of the main themes of the course was the
analysis of the social risks of land acquisition for projects and standards
that exist to mitigate these risks. According to our teachers, the worst
kind of trouble a resettlement manager encounter was to be accused of
human rights violations. The course educators mentioned repeatedly
that resettlement infringes potentially on many (human) rights issues.
While this is true, ending up on trial for human rights violations is not a
very likely scenario for a resettlement officer. Nor do resettlement officers consider possible human rights violations on a daily basis. Rather
their work is characterized by managing diverging interests and considerations involving a variety of sets of rules, laws, and standards.
In this paper I sought to describe how resettlement officers navigate
“complex plural constellations” (von Benda-Beckmann & Turner, 2018)
of multiple sets of laws and rules, such as Standards of the IFC, state
mining law and resettlement regulation, land law, human rights law,
and how they engage with a variety of actors, such as mining companies,
international finance institutes, government agencies, local populations,
and NGOs. The experiences and reflections of resettlement officers of
different mining companies in Tete shows the intricacies of implementing different sets of rules, laws, and standards and reveals that the
extent to which certain regulations are followed is not fixed. This may be
dependent on the mining company in charge, but is also shaped by
company-government relations, as well as the relations between
extractive companies and their critics. The uneven implementation of
regulations is thus not only shaped by corporate interests but also by the
management of relationships with a variety of other actors, including
state actors, (international) NGOs, watchdog organisation, and community organisations, lenders, and financial bodies. In this context,
multinational corporations are not all powerful, nor is the state totally
absent (Diphoorn & Wiegink, 2022). The mining frontier is a context in
which different sources of power and forms of rule, both state and
non-state influence and contend with each other. A focus on the
everyday intricacies of the work of resettlement officers, shows their
power and constraints, and the dynamics by which hierarchies of rules
and laws become unsettled at the extractive frontier. The result is that
resettlement projects are rather unpredictable and unaccountable pABSTRACT
Indonesia has a long and ongoing history of conflict over land between mining and plantation corporations and
communities claiming adat (customary) land rights. National law recognizes adat as a source of rights, but in a
way that makes it nearly impossible to claim land based on adat rights. This legal status and corporate land
control strategies give rise to strong feelings of injustice among communities claiming adat land. In recent years,
such communities have formed customary councils and security groups in the provinces of Kalimantan. Suggestions of potential violence are an integral element of the ways in which these groups bring adat claim to
corporations. The article argues that while violence is illegal and adat itself a weak legal ground, national law
and corporate strategies fail to address such land claims in an adequate manner.
1. Introduction
On 10 October 2021 a team of representatives of PT Laman Mining, a
bauxite mining company, visited the village of Laman Satong in the
Indonesian province of West Kalimantan.1 They came to pay an adat
(customary) fine for mining on land that, according to local custom,
belonged to some of these villagers from whom the company had not
obtained prior permission (Satria, 2021). The imposition of such adat
fines has no formal standing in Indonesian law: there hence was no
formal obligation for PT Laman Mining to pay. Yet despite lacking such a
legal basis such fines are regularly imposed in the Kalimantese provinces
by communities who seek payment from companies for what they deem
to be unauthorized usage of adat land (see Purwanto & Haryono, 2019;
Junef, 2015; Bakker, 2005). Imposing these fines is not necessarily
successful: in February 2021 PT Subur Abadi Wana Agung (PT SAWA)
an oil palm plantation company thus fined in the province of East
Kalimantan refused outright to pay or to return lands claimed by villagers in Long Bentuk. Yet such a refusal is unlikely to end the issue at
stake. Long Bentuk’s villagers have been making their claim for over
thirteen years and have no intention of dropping it (see Aman, 2021).
Such tenacity is not uncommon in adat land claims.
The cases of PT Laman Mining and PT SAWA raise two questions that
are central to this paper. Why, if adat fines lack a legal basis, would a
company pay such a fine, as PT Laman Mining did? And why would
anyone keep up such a legally unsubstantiated claim for well over a
decade, as is the case in Long Bentuk?2 The answers consist of at least
three elements: the legal basis of adat land claims (if not of adat fines),
the societal legitimacy and mobilizing potential of adat, and the
perceived injustice of the usage of such land by corporations. In consequence these combined elements can give rise to warnings -threats, from
another perspective-that continued neglect of such claims might result
in resistance and violent reactions to the company.
Adat rights and rules have a limited but substantiating role in
legislation pertaining to land and natural resources. The Indonesian
Constitution states in article 18 B that the state recognizes and respects
adat law communities and their traditional rights as long as they still live
according to these traditions and do not go against the principles of the
Republic of Indonesia. Rural communities throughout Indonesia
E-mail address: l.g.h.bakker@uva.nl. 1 This paper is based on research ongoing since 2004 on land issues in Indonesia, specifically in the four provinces of Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo.
The data presented here were gathered during various visits to the provinces of East and North Kalimantan, and to a lesser extent to West Kalimantan, between 2004
and 2019. While the research always had an additional focus on online and media research, the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic has prohibited on-site visits since.
Whatsapp, zoom and email have been used as substitutes to in-person meetings. Data was largely gathered through interviews and discussions with one-off and
returning collaborators who were offered anonymity in the usage of the material they provided. Overall some 72 interviews provided the interview material on which
this article is based. 2 Government recognition of the community as an adat village would strongly substantiate such claims. I believe that neither village is recognized as such, but
unfortunately I was unable to ascertain the current status of either village at the present time. If officially recognized, a village can include adat in its village
regulations and so include customary law into that level of government.

recognise the existence and force of hukum adat (customary law) as
regulating access to land and natural resources, yet to prove that such
traditions are ongoing customary law or that continuation of community
land usage rather than (national) company interests are in line with
national principles, is a formidable task for rural communities. The
notion that loss of customary lands to corporations is unjust is widely
spread among such communities, as are accusations that corporations
appropriate more land than they have permits for, collude with government authorities to withhold compensation intended for the population and deceive rural land users as to their legal rights in order to
make them hand over their lands, rice fields and gardens.3 Throughout
Indonesia communities resist or dispute such land take-overs and seek
better inclusion of their interests through legal as well as illegal means to
put pressure on companies (e.g. Li & Semedi, 2021; Rutten et al., 2017;
Fidh-KontraS, 2014; Semedi & Bakker, 2014). In what follows I seek to
show how in Kalimantan, specifically in the province of East Kalimantan, this combination of notions of injustice and formal entitlement
have combined with notions of adat as a source of rights to mobilize
discourses of potential violence. This presents a setting in which corporations regularly pay-off adat claimants in order to manage their
reputation, avoid hassles and keep the peace. Claiming compensation for
customary rights by threatening violence has become a profitable and
somewhat specialized spin-off activity for certain adat organizations, for
whom demands for remedying ongoing injustices as well as suggestions
of violent reprisals are part of the repertoire. Such usage of (potential)
violence and the sustaining notions of justice, is the subject of this
article.
2. Companies and adat land
Plantation companies and to a lesser extent mining companies
feature prominently in conflicts over adat land.4 The quantity and extent
of such conflicts became visible at the turn of the century when, from
1998 onwards, a new, more open and democratized style of government
made it easier for aggrieved parties to speak out and make their complaints known. From the 1970s onwards, the national government (the
New Order regime, 1966–1998) had promoted development of the
logging, plantation and mining sectors throughout the archipelago,
which became substantial and profitable sectors of the national economy. Suitable locations for such companies to operate were determined
by the presence of resources and the availability of accessible ‘empty’
lands. For plantations, soil characteristics and quality were of lesser
relevance as fertilizer and other chemicals could be used to upgrade poor
soils. The need for large plots of land made that plantations mostly
developed in sparsely populated regions of Sumatra, Papua and Kalimantan where few or no private land rights had been registered. The
selected lands were generally qualified as state land (tanah negara). That
is, land under the authority, control and management of the state.5 A
regular sequence was for forest to first be logged, after which a plantation would be developed on the logged-over site. Logging and plantation companies would receive a usage right to such land for a given
period of time, several decades not being unusual for plantations.
Indonesian law stipulates that individuals holding private land rights
that such concessions infringe upon are entitled to suitable
compensation provided their rights were demonstrable, preferably
through proof of registration. Adat land would generally not qualify for
compensation; first, because adat land usage frequently pertained to a
communal right to a broad area and, second, because individual plots –if
such existed-were rarely registered in any official form. The ensuing loss
of land gave rise to protests and resistance, but protests would often be
quelled by the police or the army and protesters be beaten or arrested.
Memories of such events are still rife among communities in today’s
plantation areas and many still consider the land loss unjust and –when
no compensation was paid-illegal (Haug, 2014; Li & Semedi, 2021).
In 1998 the New Order regime ended and was replaced by a more
democratic government that gave space to the development of civil society, public debate and independent media. As part of these developments, considerable administrative authority –including the
authority to give out concessions to mining and plantation companieswas decentralized from the national level of government to that of the
provinces and, below these, to that of the districts (kabupaten) and city
(kota) governments. In the Kalimantese provinces as well as elsewhere
the number of concessions awarded increased dramatically. With
various levels of government authorized to give out concessions but no
central administration of these, a plot of land could be the subject of
multiple concessions given out to various companies by different levels
of government. In the province of East Kalimantan, which has some of
the largest plantation and mining operations in the country, an overlap
in concessions of nearly 4,5 million hectares was established in 2019
(FEL GM 2019). In the past few years legislation has been developed to
solve such overlaps, yet its implementation is still insufficient. Nasir
et al. (2022), found that multiple conflicts resulted from these overlaps
between multiple constellations of companies, communities and
(regional) governments.
Creating such overlaps appears to have been a conscious strategy for
companies and a minor concern for some government officials involved.
My fieldwork in East Kalimantan yielded various ways in which plantation and mining companies used overlaps to control strategic plots and
so stall or thwart competitors.6 Companies sought to build up land banks
for their own future expansion as well as to deny competitors access.
Such blockages could be attempted in various ways. A company could,
for instance, ensure that it would have an information source in the
relevant government office from whom it would hear where competitor
intended to become active. The company could then seek to obtain a
concession permit for that area before its competitor did, or for another
location of strategic importance to the competitor’s intended location,
such as existing access roads. The company could also apply for a permit
from another government level or agency, so creating an overlap that
could be used to threaten a legal procedure and discourage the
competitor from becoming active. The company could also request a
permit from the same government office as its competitor but arrange
for it to be backdated to establish an ulterior right. Even if such practices
would not always withstand rigorous examination, the ensuing administrative and legal hassle could delay the competitor’s activities
considerably or require a financial settlement benefitting the first
company. Another strategy was to begin new work outside rather than
within the borders of a newly obtained concession. The logic is that the
permit area was secure as legal title had been obtained and could be a
base from which to informally add neighbouring areas which –once
planted-would become part of the plantation. Permits to the area would
then be arranged once the ‘mistake’ was discovered, such as when
competitors showed an interest. A third strategy was to act fast and
develop a location without a permit or a nearby concession. For instance
when rival prospectors working with a research permit –but still lacking
3 See Kouwagam (2020) on corporate land practices and de Vos (2019) for an
ethnographic study of land acquisition for plantation development. 4 Of the 241 such land conflicts registered in 2020 b y the Agrarian Reform
Consortium (a prominent and specialized NGO) 122 involved plantations and
12 concerned mining companies (Konsorsium Pembaruan Agraria, 2020, pp.
4–5).
5 The National Constitution’s article 33 identifies the state as the authority
controlling land, water and natural resources and instructs that sectors of the
economy that are of importance to the country and affect the lives of the
population, are to be controlled by the state.
6 Here I specifically refer to a series of some 20 interviews I had between
2007 and 2017 with company officials and land brokers –but Indonesian and
foreign-on strategies to obtain rights and access to land. As illegal strategies
were freely discussed, the individual interlocutors will remain anonymous here.

a land usage permit or a business development permit-established the
presence of coal reserves sufficiently large and accessible to warrant
such a step. If a company disposed of strong contacts in relevant government offices or among the national business elite, it could get away
with such a ‘hijacking’ of a location. Especially if it also enlisted the
support of regional government, the police or the military, local village
heads and such societal or adat organizations as may be active in the
area.
Such strategies pose a nuisance to many and are complex to counter.
In many instances local (adat) communities initially sought government
assistance to resolve ensuing land conflicts and when this failed sought
to address matters through litigation (see for instance Bakhtiar et al.,
2019; Berenschot et al., 2021; Tim Inkuiri Nasional Komnas, 2016).
Such communities may lose lands, gardens and rice fields. Governments
expecting income through taxes on production may fail to see such
revenue materialize when lands are not formally brought under development or become the subject of lengthy procedures. Measures such as
the 2015 launch of the One Stop Investment Licensing Service
(Pelayanan Terpadu Satu Pintu), the ongoing development of a national
One Map Geoportal Policy (Geoportal Kebijakan Satu Peta) and the
recentralization of the authority to give out land permits to the central
level of government, are strong drives to unify land usage data and do
away with the fuzziness and multiplicity of authorized actors that makes
such strategies effective. Yet implementing legislation for such new
policies is frequently still lacking and existing permits remain valid, also
those awarded by lower governments. Existing problems thus remain.
Furthermore, the new policies also attract considerable criticism for
their perceived inabilities to solve the issue of adat rights to land. WALHI
(2020), a nationwide Indonesian NGO, notes for instance how the data
for the One Map Geoportal Policy establishes a 19,3% overlap for all of
Kalimantan, but that despite earlier intensions customary village
boundaries and adat territories have not been included in the data used.
Such omissions will do little to solve the problem.
3. Adat and national law
Adat claims to land and other natural resources are tenacious and
frequently ingrained with a notion of injustice. Adat rights to land,
proponents claim, existed before colonization and before the Indonesian
state came into being. They have been repressed since colonial times but
form a substantive and authentic source of norms and regulation that
should not be ignored. These rights, they argue, go back to the original
Indonesian society, which makes denial oppressive to the Indonesians
themselves. Opponents counter that such unwritten and highly diverse
local rules do not suffice to provide the clarity, equality and rule of law
required for the functioning of a modern nation state. Law should be
predictable and accountable, which is in this perspective not the case
with adat. Uniform and national law is more fair and more efficient.7
Adat presently holds a position between these two stances in Indonesia’s legal order (see Bedner & Arizona, 2019; Safitri & Moeliono,
2010). It is recognized as an original source of rights, particularly land
rights, in legislation.8 The Basic Agrarian Law of 1960, the main law
regulating land rights up to the present, states in its article 5 that the law
pertaining to the land is adat law, but in article 3 that communal adat
rights –which is the most common form of adat land claims-must be
exercised in accordance with national interest and existing law.
Furthermore, in article 6 it is stipulated that the rights to land should
have a social function. The combined meaning of articles 3 and 6 thus is
that (adat) land rights might be superseded by interests with a greater
benefit to society. Particularly during the New Order regime, but also in
the present, plantations and mines qualify as having such as societally
beneficial and thus supersede individual or communal adat land claims.
Adat rights thus are no dead letter, but to obtain official recognition
is far from easy. There is, for instance, a possibility to obtain official
recognition of communal adat land rights –known as hak ulayat-through
Minister of Agrarian Affairs Regulation 5 of 1999 which detailed a
procedure for lower governments to evaluate such a request from a
community. For this to happen, a community first needs to be recognized by its regional government as an adat law community, that is, a
community still adhering to its own adat in its daily life. If this adat
community then is found to engage in communal land usage it can
request (with endorsement of its regional government) for mapping and
registration of tanah ulayat (communally held land) by the National
Land Agency.9 While a few communities managed to obtain recognition
as an adat community, registration of communal adat land has so far
hardly taken place as local governments appear hesitant to arrange for
what is essentially a release of land from their authority (see Bakker,
2007; Bedner, 2016).10 Furthermore, while the 2014 Plantation Law
instructs companies to consult with communities if ulayat lands are
required for plantation development, the law does not say that agreement has to be reached before development can begin. In other words,
without agreement ulayat lands can still be used in practice (de Vos,
2019; Jasmir, 2018). Recent years have seen a variety of other legal,
governmental and civil society initiatives, such as for village adat land,
but none delivering a clear procedure for recognition or rejection (see
van der Muur et al., 2019; Bedner & Arizona, 2019).
Yet absence of legal recognition does not mean claims are abandoned; rather they are substantiated in different ways. Adat also functions as an influential socio-cultural identifier. This became quite clear
following the 1998 regime change and the decentralization of administrative authority to lower levels of government. With provincial governors, regional heads and parliaments on these levels directly elected
by the constituencies of their territories rather than appointed by central
government, connections to the local populations became relevant factors. Whereas ethnic and cultural differences were carefully managed as
non-issues in the past, they became relevant factors through decentralization and local elections (see Aspinall & Fealy, 2003). Candidates
brought ethnicity into politics as a rallying factor. Indigeneity as putra
daerah (‘local children’) became relevant in political elections, contrasting such candidates and their followers to migrants originating from
elsewhere in the archipelago (see Sakai, 2002). Discourses of indigeneity
and indigenous rights that frequently involve notions of adat land have
become successful mobilizers of ethnic groups (see Li, 2000; Hauser-Schaublin, ¨ 2013, pp. 9–11). This also raises the issue of adat as a
limiting category of rights that excludes other Indonesians from rights
available to those lucky enough to be born into an adat community (see
Henley & Davidson, 2007). Such exclusion is not in line with the Indonesian Constitution which decrees that land and resources should be
developed to the benefit of all, thus making enforcement of such exclusivity problematic and perhaps illegal. That does not however do
away with the understanding among communities that the loss of their
adat lands is unjust.
7 See for example Slaats et al. (2009) for a discussion of the legal aspects of
adat. Bourchier (2014) on its role in state building discourse. With ‘national
law’ I refer to such legislation as is put forward by the national government, but
it should be noted that provincial and regional governments in Indonesia may
also promulgate legislation governing adat communities and adat rights. 8 See Bedner (2016) and Butt and Lindsey (2018, pp. 143–161) for comprehensive overviews of the position of adat in Indonesian (land) law.
9 That is, provided no other Basic Agrarian Law-derived rights have been
registered for this land, as these take precedence. 10 Another issue is that many communities that might want to claim ulayat
land technically live in areas where the land is not under the authority of local
governments. Even if these are willing to do so, they cannot give these communities such rights.

4. Violent strategies in adat land conflicts
The increased political openness and administrative decentralization
that began in 1998 did take place in a time of crisis. In the Kalimantese
provinces population groups claiming indigeneity to the regions
–especially Dayak, but also Paserese, Kutai and others-argued that large
parts of their lands had been seized by corporations, the state and migrants from other parts of Indonesia. While those parties profited,
spokespersons argued, the original population did not. Even worse, they
were categorically excluded from such development as was taking place
on the lands around them. 11 Complaints were ignored, protests broken
up by the police or the military and protesters detained. Tensions came
to the boil in the provinces of West and Central Kalimantan in a series of
conflicts in 1997, 1999 and 2001, when indigenous Dayak and Malayu
killed hundreds of Madurese transmigrants and forcibly evicted many
thousands more.12 The violence shocked Indonesian society but reinforced a stereotype of Dayak as fierce fighters with traditions of headhunting and black magic. An older image that had been somewhat
overtaken by another, development-oriented image of Dayak as poor
and primitive rural dwellers on the margins of society, but that now reemphasized their potential for violence.
In the nearby province of East Kalimantan no such violence took
place, but events in West and Central Kalimantan mobilized indigenous
identity there as well. East Kalimantan has some of the most extensive
mining and plantation areas in the country and even though indigenous
groups make up a relatively small part –some ten percent-of the population, feelings of injustice over loss of adat lands is widespread in some
of these communities as well. Following the violence, various organizations seeking to represent indigenous interests came to the fore in the
province. Many of these were established with a local focus and formed
along specific ethnic lines, which meant that it was not uncommon for
them to number no more than a few dozen members at first. Over time
such groups merged under charismatic leaders whose leadership, rather
than clear agendas, provided direction. A few such groups, such as the
Dayak Adat Council of Kalimantan (Dewan Adat Dayak se-Kalimantan,
hereafter DADK) put emphasis on a Kalimantan-wide political panDayakism and the establishment of a structure of adat councils in
which experts would explain and apply adat rules to settle conflicts (see
Bakker, 2009; Buchari, 2014). Other groups developed into more
activist bodies championing adat and indigenous interests, which would
frequently be explained as the provision of security and the representation of Dayak rights (see Bakker, 2015). The councils and security
groups collaborate, the latter sometimes acting as the executive branch
enforcing the council’s decision.
Dressed in a mixture of military-style uniform and traditional
costume, members of these security groups catch the eye during protests
and other public manifestations: army boots and camouflage are combined with feathered headgear, string baskets and beadwork jewellery.
They explain their presence not as part of the protest, but as keeping
order: they ensure that protesting Dayak keep calm and no such violence
as took place in West and Central Kalimantan –for which the current
image of Dayak ensures the potential-will occur. Yet to non-Dayak
spectators they also emanate a threat: their ethnic and militant
appearance is a strong reminder of exactly that capacity and their
organized presence suggests that the group is able to operate in a
disciplined way. “As long as they wear those costumes, there is no need
to worry’, a senior police official explained to me in 2016, ‘If they get up
to violence, it will occur afterwards, and they [the perpetrators] will be
anonymous’. In terms of security their message is twofold: the wellbeing
of protesters or such adat officials as might be present is ensured, but the
security of those against whom the protest is directed is put into question. There is no violence now, but that might follow if rights must be
enforced.
An example of the collaboration between an adat council and an
ethnic security group is the following sequence of events that took place
in the district of Paser in East Kalimantan in 2005. A local Dayak farmer
maintained that part of his family lands had been taken in use by a
plantation company a decade earlier, without their consent and without
compensation payments being made. At the time he had not dared to
protest, knowing that the political regime did not hold with such complaints and fearing a violent reaction by the police. Besides, he had no
official title to the land aside from his adat claim. By 2005 the establishment of a Dayak adat council in the nearby city of Balikpapan had
him decide to ask for their assistance. A council member came to visit
and established, based on reports from neighbours and the village’s adat
head, that the land at stake indeed was locally considered to belong to
the farmer’s family. The council member considered the grounds for this
claim and agreed that they were legitimate as per local adat. He reported
his findings in writing and addressed these to the plantation company
with a request for a return of the lands or, if this was not possible,
payment of an indemnification. As no reply was received, the council
member went to the plantation to ask after their answer. He went
accompanied by the head of a local security group who was known to
both the plantation supervisor and the local police, as the security group
leader was a retired police official. The plantation supervisor received
them politely but explained that he could do nothing. His company held
official deeds to the land which overruled other claims. Personally, he
felt regretful, but the decision was made by more senior managers
elsewhere. The two men left, but a few days later the security group
leader returned to see the manager again. He was now accompanied by
about a dozen members all dressed in white shirts and carrying mandau
(a Dayak machete) on their belts.13 The group leader explained to the
supervisor that word had reached him of the company’s refusal to
accommodate the farmer and that various people among the larger adat
community in the area were quite upset. These people, he continued, felt
that the company had profited from the land for well over a decade
without being asked for anything in return. A refusal now was tantamount to stealing the land away from its rightful owner. The security
group had come to warn the supervisor that a continued refusal to heed
the plight of the farmer could make for a violent reaction from among
the angered population. The leader had heard that plans were at hand to
burn plantation buildings and cut down or poison its trees. He and his
group would try to prevent this and maintain order as per their role in
local society, but he could give no guarantees. Yet he had two solutions
to propose. First, the company would pay the farmer the long overdue
compensation, in exchange for which the company would be allowed to
continue using the land. Second, the plantation would hire members of
the security group to guard its territory from damages by those angered
by the company’s initial refusal, until thinks settled down again.14 Both
propositions were accepted by the manager so as to avoid further
trouble.
Such actions are not uncommon. Once the palms are bearing fruit, oil
palm plantation companies are relatively vulnerable. With very few
people working on the plantations it is relatively easy for outsiders to
enter the extensive plantations and damage or poison trees or burn
heaps of harvested fruits (by pouring gasoline over them). Plantation

but the full complexity is beyond the range of this paper. See van Klinken
(2007) for a more extensive discussion.
13 When I wondered whether the mandau served a practical or martial purpose
I was told that they were cultural artefacts part of the group’s attire. I asked
whether they would not be experienced as intimidating to which the group’s
leader answered that such was not intended. On this leader, see also Bakker
(2021). 14 The security group and adat council received a gratification for their
assistance as well.

workers often are low-paid immigrant workers brought in from other
parts of Indonesia with little sympathy for or loyalty to the company.
They generally prefer to keep out of these conflicts for fear of being
targeted as land-stealing outsiders and avoid or ignore such saboteurs
should they come across them. Plantation management is aware of this
and is usually willing to pay to avoid such hassles (see also Li, 2018, p.
333), provided the group does not make too much of a public event of
their success or comes by too often. Overall sums involved are relatively
low, ranging between several hundred and two- or three thousand dollars. Where public opinion is brought in, for instance through protesters
setting up roadblocks or seeking attention for their plight through media
or NGO assistance, companies are generally less quick to settle, as is
illustrated by the case of Long Bentuk and PT SAWA with which this
paper opened, especially since such settlement is likely considerably
more expensive.
Threats of violence, arson or vandalism thus have come to sustain
adat land claims where legal status of such claims does not suffice. If
posing quite a contrast to recourse to the law or NGO intervention, such
threats deliver results in the form of cash payments, (temporary)
employment or –sometimes- land usage arrangements between adat
plaintiffs and plantation management. The complexity of adat’s legal
standing sanctions such potential violence and –somewhat ironicallyhas substantiated the rise of such modern-day customary councils and
security groups.
5. Conclusion
A photograph depicting the meeting between the team of PT Laman
Mining and the villagers of Laman Satong sees them posing behind
multiple stacks of plates while an impressive earthenware jar is being
handed over (Satria, 2021). Adat fines in Kalimantan are customarily
expressed in such goods, an aspect that must continue as it shows the
ongoing adherence to traditional rules. Yet these goods are mostly
symbolic today as their financial value is relatively low. The fine also
includes a financial component which is not visible in the picture nor
made public in another way. The image is illustrative of the situation
discussed in the above. Adat, a source of land rights that is recognized in
Indonesian law but that is almost unclaimable in reality forms a focal
point of notions of unjust land dispossession and a unifying and mobilizing factor for such groups as maintain to have it. Like the jar, its value
is not in its immediate usage but in the meaning that sits behind it. In
Kalimantan feelings of injustice run deep and go back decades, causing
claimants of adat land to have little confidence in official law as a forum
to have their grievances addressed. Alternatives such as offered by
non-state, ethnically exclusive and potentially violent adat organizations
are problematic from a democratic and rule of law perspective, but they
do address the grievances and suggest a measure of recognition through
the payments they obtain. Yet such payments are relatively small sums,
and the suggestion of violent capacities brings a degree of coercion.
Especially plantations are vulnerable, and the management is frequently
willing to buy off such threats for small occasional sums. Although
temporarily satisfactory, these payments do little to settle the issue in
the long term. Another claim may follow in due time, as adat claimants
generally maintain to have an ongoing right and companies pay
compensation for usage. Notions of injustice stimulate adat’s prominence and legitimize the somewhat shady strategies employed in
seeking payments from companies, but on a more structural level this
phenomenon is indicative of a shortcoming in land governance that
requires a more fundamental solutionSince the turn of the century more people in Latin America have been
killed or otherwise afflicted by violence and insecurity than during the
times of dictatorship, repressive regimes, guerrilla uprisings, and armed
conflict (1960s–1990s). Latin America has turned into what is on
average the most lethal region in the world in terms of homicide rates.
The 2013 Regional Human Development Report (UNDP 2013, v) mentions that “in the last decade, more than one million people have died in
Latin America and the Caribbean as a result of criminal violence”. In
2012, Latin America’s citizens represented only 8 percent of the world’s
population; however, they produced around 37 percent of the world’s
homicides in that year (Chioda, 2017, 1). Since then, regional statistics
have not really improved.1
Formally at peace and formally democratic, one of the most salient
aspects of this violence is that it is not explicitly directed at acquiring or
defending state power. Rather, it is labelled ‘criminal’ or ‘social’ and
includes not only everyday forms of direct violence and coercion but
also institutional and symbolic forms of violence. These dimensions, in
turn, rest upon a long history of social inequality, exclusion, and elite
privileges that are often enveloped as structural violence.
Except for drug-related violence corridors in Colombia, Central
America and Mexico, Latin American violence is largely urban (Koonings & Kruijt, 2015). According to the Mexican NGO Seguridad, Justicia
y Paz (2020), of the 10 most lethal cities of 300,000 inhabitants or more
in the world in 2020, seven are Mexican. Of the 50 most lethal cities, 40
are Latin American or Caribbean: 17 are Mexican, 11 Brazilian, six
Venezuelan, two Honduran, two Colombian, one Jamaican, and one
Puerto Rican. Of the remaining cities, five are American and five South
African.2
What is behind these dismal statistics? After the disappearance of the
dictatorships and the re-democratisation process in the course of the
1980s new and violent non-state actors emerged, not aiming at revolutionary political transformations like the former guerrilla groups but
aspiring to become a ‘regular’ element with prestige and negotiating
power in the economy and society. They operate in criminal, violent,
clandestine or at least extra-legal ambiences. But they are not hidden or
invisible. They vigorously put forth their claims to local, municipal,
regional, and national involvement. They control larger or smaller territories or commercial corridors for smuggling, levy taxes on ‘their’
people, provide ‘protection’ by eliminating ‘adversaries’ (legal or illegal
competitors) and try to establish an economy of uninterrupted profits
and a society of continued legal impunity, replacing official rule of law
by criminal justice and extra-legal order making. So, despite the
apparent non-political nature of this system of violence, it does have farreaching repercussions for social life as well as for politics, governance,
the law, and the state. In this contribution we seek to examine the implications of contemporary violence in Latin America for order making
and governance.
The article is developed as follows. As a starting point we combine
two concepts, namely protracted hybrid conflict and criminal governance, to frame the paradox of violence in Latin America. This paradox
rests on the proposition that chronic violence coincides with formally
democratic states that are, in a conventional sense, not at war. We will
then look briefly at the historical context of violence, state and hybrid
order making in Latin America. Subsequently we will explore three
specific and intersecting mechanisms of criminal governance in Latin
America: state capture, layered micro-sovereignty, and state

transgression. In the conclusions we will reflect on the political implications of criminal governance in relation to debates about post-violence
and more peaceful forms of order and rule.
2. Protracted conflict, hybrid violence, criminal governance
We concur with Barnes’ (2017: 968) argument in favour of the inclusion of chronic criminal violence into the debates on political conflict
and violence. Chronic urban and criminal violence has in fact been
incorporated in recent scholarship of protracted armed conflict. In
particular urban areas have come to be seen not only as emerging sites
for asymmetrical warfare but also as arenas of new, long-lasting, hybrid
forms of armed conflict and collective violence. At first sight this refers
to notorious examples of intra-state armed conflict being waged in or
extended to cities, or cities being affected by the economic, social and
political spill-overs of war (Beall et al., 2011; Esser, 2004). Well-known
examples of cities in so-called war-torn countries in the post-World War
II and post-Cold War era include Beirut, Mogadishu, Medellín, Karachi,
Goma, Kabul, Bagdad, Mosul, Homs, and Aleppo. In some cases the term
urbicide has been used (Fregonese, 2009) while a plethora of case
studies show the entanglement of politics-driven armed conflict with
other forms of interpersonal, economic, criminal, and social violence
(Büscher, 2012; Pech et al., 2018). The hybridity of these protracted
conflicts emerges from the fusion of military confrontations, factionalist
political violence, and organized crime, as well as the impact on
socio-spatial regimes, governance, and power relations.
In Latin America, the use of war frames to analyse or denounce this
violence is commonplace. Both the statistical magnitude and lived experiences of violence in many urban areas and in specific production
zones and trade corridors of the drugs economy in Latin America
resemble violence in conflict-torn cities, regions, and countries elsewhere. Notions such as ‘war on crime’, ‘war on drugs’, and ‘pacification’
are widely used in Latin America. Increasingly this criminal and urban
violence has been addressed by a securitized and militarized doctrine for
public order and law enforcement that resonates with the post-911
discourse of the ‘war on terror’ (Müller & Hochmüller, 2017). In turn,
the debate on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and reconstruction
lacks a clear perspective on how to relate standard peacebuilding formats to the hybrid violence in such protracted urban conflicts not just in
Latin America but across the globe (Turkmani, 2022).
Still, there are significant differences between the Latin American
violence and other, more conventional forms of protracted hybrid conflict. The most important divergence lies in the articulation of Latin
American violence with relatively consolidated and formally democratic
states. This has profound consequences for order making that cannot
simply be reduced to the often-mentioned fragility of the rule of law – or
even the state as such - in contemporary Latin American democracies.
Therefore, to unravel the hybrid entanglement of violent crime and legal
governance within this type of protracted conflict we will use the notion
of criminal governance which we see as a specific elaboration of Arias
and Goldstein’s (2010) concept of ‘violent democracy’.
We understand criminal governance to be the exercise of power or
the ability to govern for illicit objectives (partly) outside of the legalbureaucratic-democratic frame of the modern state or by corrupting or
transgressing the latter’s institutional boundaries. This exercise of
power or ability to govern not only rests on the appropriation and
application of the means of coercion beyond the legal state monopoly
but also on the reconfiguration of rules and laws as a strategy of order
making and legitimization. Put differently, rules and laws are part of the
ordering dimension of criminal governance both in terms of it being
effective (in power, resource extraction, disciplining) and ‘legitimizable’
(in the sense of seeking but not necessarily obtaining legitimacy). This
notion of criminal governance resonates with debates on plural or
hybrid order making (Arias, 2017; Arias & Davis Rodríguez, 2006;
Dewey, Míguez, & Saín, 2017). Criminal governance is not (just) rule by
criminals; it is built upon complex entanglements of collaboration,
collusion, and substitution that involve the legal state and non-state,
extra-legal and violent actors. We agree with Dewey et al. (2017) that
these hybrid orders are not only backstopped by coercion but also by
legitimacy provided by functional outcomes in terms of livelihood, social order, and protection.3
To further unravel the role of criminal governance in relation to
protracted hybrid violence in Latin America we examine three basic and
often intersecting mechanisms of criminal governance: (1) state capture
by extra-legal and violent actors, meaning that politics and state institutions are influenced or controlled by agents that have a criminal or
coercive agenda; (2) sovereignty disputes at the local level when nonstate armed actors establish territorial forms of control in a setting of
‘layered’ or ‘nested’ sovereignty; (3) state transgression, meaning state
agents and institutions that engage in extra-legal economic and political
forms of conduct. We will suggest that these mechanisms of violent
order making invoke peculiar sets of rules and laws, respectively dubbed
quasi-legality, layered rulemaking and legal transgression. But before
we go into this typology, we will briefly sketch the historical and sociopolitical context of violence, state, and order making in Latin America.
3. State, criminal power and hybrid order making
Early twenty-first century Latin American democracy is intrinsically
violent and violent pluralism has been normalized in social and political
life and the functioning of many state institutions (Arias & Goldstein,
2010). The interplay between the state and violence generates variegated yet interlocking dynamics of the criminalization of governance.
We do not reduce this problem to state weakness or state fragility as
such. State weakness is not a helpful notion if it rests on a mere catalogue
of peripheral shortcomings vis-a-vis ` the central (or North Atlantic) ideal
type of the legal nation-state. Rather we seek to understand the endemic
and historically grounded entanglements of the legal state (that is often
quite strong or at least big) and extra-legal actors as co-producers of
violence.
A first entry point is provided by the history of state-making in Latin
America. In all but a few Latin American states (notable exceptions often
mentioned are Chile, Costa Rica and Uruguay) this history generated
cycles of elitist and authoritarian rule, personalism and patrimonialism
as tools of the political trade, and limited and contested institutionalization of politics and public policy. This had implications for coercion
and internal pacification as a register of state strength or weakness.
Formally liberal-constitutional and secular from its inception, Latin
American state making not only took recourse to cycles of state
authoritarianism but also relied on the outsourcing of public violence to
local power holders and private ‘violence brokers’ (Cruz, 2016; Hau,
2014). Under neoliberalism, Latin American states reinvented coercive
violence through securitization of development (Müller & Hochmüller,
2017) and criminalization of poverty and protest (Wacquant, 2003), to
wage, in Gledhill’s (2015) terms a ‘new war on the poor’.
This trajectory of state-making also generated a legal paradox often
attributed to the region. On the one hand, Latin American nation-states
appear ‘hyper-legalistic’: the propensity to codify political relations,
3 Dewey et al. (2017) build their conceptual argument on the idea that formal
and informal forms of order and rule are combined. Although we also use the
term ‘informal’ in this paper, this is mostly in a vernacular sense to indicate the
absence of legal codification and institutional recognition, from the point of
view of the legal state. However, the essence of the concept of hybridity, that
we prefer, is that it allows to go beyond the dualism that is implicit in the
formal/informal dichotomy. Formal rules and institutions (including forms of
violence, as in public law enforcement) may at the same time serve other
agendas – such as extortion - and take different shapes – like extrajudicial executions. The inverse is also the case, for instance in situations of gang or
vigilante rule in cities like Kingston, S˜
ao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro where de
facto control of extra-legal armed actors impose a de facto legitimate order in
collusion with state entities and politicians.

public institutions, and social norms in an elaborate corpus of laws and
regulations through which the centrality and sovereignty of order
making through the legal state is constantly performed (Sieder et al.,
2019). On the other hand, laws and regulations are subjugated, in
practice, to the structures and contingencies of power and privilege
mediated by horizontal and hierarchical social relations: obedezco pero
no cumplo or para os amigos tudo, para los inimigos: a lei are often invoked
apocryphal dictums. Rather than seeing this as a form of pre-modern
cultural dualism we understand this legal paradox as an environment
that is conducive to the hybridization of law under violence and criminal
governance in recent decades. Hyper-legalism and the proliferation of
legal professionalism have been a strategy to counterbalance the
vulnerability of the law, legal institutions, and legal practice. This has
been put in even sharper profile by the current wave of violence in
‘democratic’ Latin America: Moriconi (2018: 499) concludes that the
“norm of legality has lost its moral persuasive power” making the illegal
legitimate; and Schultze-Kraft, Chinchilla, and Moriconi (2018: 470)
speak of “crimilegal orders”. So, criminal governance rests on coercive
violence and the hybridization of rules and laws.
As we will explore in more detail in the following sections, the
reconfiguration of order, law and rules under violence and criminal
governance rests on specific problems of ‘stateness’. First, the limitations
of state capacity produce not just violent and fragmented (‘transgressive’) law enforcement as such but what M´endez, O’Donnell and
Pinheiro (1999) have called the ‘unrule of law’: punitive state violence,
misapplication of legal norms, and impunity, especially towards the
excluded sectors of society that figure as second- or third-class citizens.
Second, limitation and fragmentation of the reach of state institutions
and the interlocked emergence of non-state violent actors reshape sovereignty in socio-spatial terms. The legal state suffers a fragmentation or
breakdown of sovereignty while non-state, extra-legal or criminal ‘sovereigns’ appear to produce this breakdown and fill the voids (Koonings,
2012). If we define sovereignty in an abstract sense as the manifest and
internally and externally endorsed capacity to rule and govern, recent
scholarship has expanded the classical notion of exclusive territorial and
legal sovereignty wielded by states into notions such as nested, layered
or hybrid sovereignty (Blom Hansen & Steputtat, 2006) and into other
domains than politico-territorial rule. Such multiple articulations of
sovereignty point at diverse ways in which violent coercion and subjective legitimacy to rule territories and populations can be combined
beyond the boundaries of legal citizenship. Third, inequality and
exclusion both underlie and are reproduced by the intersection of state
fragmentation, violent actors, and hybrid sovereignty (Jaffe, 2013).
Thus, an ecology of structural violence ensues where disjunctive
citizenship, informal livelihood, vulnerability, and grey spaces reproduce, normalize and lend legitimacy to violence as an acceptable
ordering principle. We locate our three types of criminal governance and
hybridized order making in this environment of violent democracy.
4. Political infiltration and state capture
Criminal and violent actors have an interest in politics and state
power for two fundamental reasons: protection and leverage. Protection
means shielding their activities and organizations either directly by
preventing law enforcement operations or more generally through
influencing security and other relevant policies. Leverage means using
the state to boost their illicit interests and to diversify in new and
apparently legal economic and political fields, e.g., through laundering,
clientelism, or electoral politics. The mechanisms to achieve this are
infiltration of politics, the capture of public office and state institutions,
bending or neutralizing the application of formal law, or performing as if
being endowed by official legality as a ‘state simulacrum’. Criminal
actors rely on a combination of resources to achieve this, in particular
corruption, coercion, and constituencies. Corruption means the use of
economic resources to influence politicians and civil servants or to
occupy positions in the state. Coercion is based on the capacity to wield
extra-legal violence to pressure state agents and populations into
compliance. Constituencies refer to the mobilization of popular support
and the creation of legitimacy, again using a combination of economic,
social, cultural, and legal resources (Dewey et al., 2017). Depending on
the size, reach, and interest of the criminal actors, infiltration and capture occurs at different levels of scale and can be incidental or systematic. Here we focus on criminal (drug trafficking) cartels as the most
visible agents of state infiltration and capture in Latin America.
The scale of action of the large cartel-type drug trafficking organizations, most notoriously in Colombia and Mexico, their degree of internal organisation, their level of armament, and their budget volume is
of vital importance. The immense cash surplus originated by drugs
production and transport allows the leadership to corrupt and buy
civilian authorities, politicians, judges, prosecutors, police officers,
military commanders, mayors and municipal and regional authorities,
and even cabinet members (Grillo, 2016; Lessing, 2019; Teiner, 2020).
Trafficking of drugs is also trafficking of influence, by intimidation or
corruption. The flip side of corruption is coercion. The unbridled possibility to use violence enables coercion by executions of authorities and
community leaders, by killing and kidnapping of opponents and ‘enemies’, by extortion of uncooperative entrepreneurs and bankers, and by
killing or intimidating journalists. Mexico has become one of the most
dangerous countries for journalists. The third pillar, constituencies, allows armed and criminal actors to mobilise support in exchange for
employment and protection, to influence or infiltrate the state. The arrests, in 2020, of General Cienfuegos (Mexico’s secretary of defense
2012–2018) as Padrino of the H2 cartel and of Mexico’s top official
Genaro García Luna (head of Mexico’s Federal Investigation Agency
2001–2005 and secretary of public security 2006–2012) because he
accepted bribes from the Sinaloa cartel demonstrate these close encounters between the legal and the criminal (further underscored by
Cienfuegos’ subsequent release after a Mexican diplomatic demarche).4
The enormous economic surpluses generated by these organizations,
coupled with their widely known use of specialized security outfits and
groups of sicarios (contract killers), enable the leaders to infiltrate in the
political structures, ‘buying’ members of parliament to obtain legislation
and exemptions, mayors (for identity papers), and functionaries at the
registration offices (for property titles). They finance electoral campaigns to control politicians. They employ the services of individual
policemen and officers of the armed forces, as intimidating vigilantes or
members of ‘cleansing groups’ (see a.o. Brophy, 2008). Higher echelons
of the security forces can also be bought. In some extreme situations
(Pablo Escobar was the most significant example) they nurture public
ambitions and provide themselves with political functions. But the
widespread use of recruited politicians (known in Colombia as parapolíticos like in ‘paramilitaries’) is less ostentatious (Romero 2007; Lopez ´
Hernandez, ´ 2010). Control and penetration mechanisms in nearly all
Latin American countries are manifold, if not at the national, then surely
at the municipal levels, also in the megacities of Buenos Aires, Rio de
Janeiro, Sao ˜ Paulo, Mexico City and Caracas (Kruijt & Koonings, 2015):
direct infiltration in the executive (cabinet members) and the legislature; buying influence, protection by the security forces (the armed
forces, the police, the intelligence bodies); interference with the electoral system (financing candidates during electoral campaigns); influence in the mass media (by selective assassinations of journalists and
installing fear that causes self-censorship); local forms of ‘armed clientelism’ (violence-backed carrot and stick policies); and interference
with social movements (from social protesters to indigenous
movements).
If we oversee this bewildering panorama three basic modalities of
political infiltration and state capture come to the fore. First, the

corruption or extortion of state agents or institutions to protect or support criminal organizations and activities. More run of the mill examples
would be the bribing of judges, local police commanders, mayors, and
civil servants as well as the capture of public funds and projects through
‘armed clientelism’. Second, we see the self-attribution of state functions
by criminal or coercive groups who in many cases adopt the label of
autodefensas. Crime fighting and community protection are adopted as
remits for legitimation and serves as a barely effective cloak for criminal
enterprise. Third, there are the efforts to directly influence or enter
politics, mostly through campaign funding or vote-banking. The implications of this order-making mechanisms for rules and laws are what we
call ‘quasi-legality’. Seeking such a hybrid relation to the legal state for
protection and impunity, capturing rents from public funds, wielding
state power directly, or performing a simulacrum of the state, would
allow violent and criminal agents and groups to mobilise or twist formal
rules and laws to support their economic, social, and political purpose.
5. Power in gangland: urban sovereignty disputes and territorial
control
The second mechanism of criminal governance that has become
increasingly prevalent in Latin America and the Caribbean is ‘territorial
power’: the domination of specific spaces by criminal or extra-legal
armed actors, most often urban gangs (in many cities) and territorial
vigilante, paramilitary, or drug trafficking groups (mostly in urban and
rural areas of Colombia, Central America, and Mexico). In this section
we will focus on urban ganglands.
Conventional armed conflicts are inscribed in space, making territorial control, the establishment of frontlines, rear-guard areas, and noman’s lands of key importance. However, Latin American hybrid urban
violence recasts this spatial dimension. On the one hand, territoriality
matters to drug trafficking organizations, urban gangs, and vigilantes.
Likewise, state responses of securitization are played out in specific
areas (and not in others). Co-governance between criminal actors,
violence brokers, and politicians is often connected to specific territories. As a result the impact of violence, insecurity, and fear on urban
societies and spaces of the drugs economy in Latin America has been
particularly profound. Many cities in the region can be seen as ‘fractured’. In many of these areas we see the emergence of so-called microsovereignties in which non-state armed actors seek to establish governance over urban areas and populations that is not only based on
coercion and fear but also on legitimation and consent (Arias & Davis
Rodríguez, 2006; Jaffe, 2013). The socio-spatial impact of violence extends beyond the urban margins affecting sociality, lived experience as
well as public and political mobilization at the level of entire cities and
even countries (Glebbeek & Koonings, 2016: 6).
On the other hand, Latin American violence is not only circumscribed in terms of space. The notion of ‘margins’ is useful to understand
that there are institutional and socio-cultural dimensions to hybrid
violence that are not (only) defined in a territorial sense (Auyero,
Bourgois, & Scheper-Hughes, 2015). There is little doubt that urban
violence predominantly affects ‘marginal’ – or more appropriately ‘peripheral’ and ‘subaltern’ (see Roy, 2011) – populations and areas in
these cities. Although this is often related to geographical peripheries it
also refers to the deep entanglements of violence and insecurity with the
urban assemblage in all its dimensions: well-to-do areas in the ‘formal
city’ and its residents, the articulations of legal, semi-legal and illicit
domains of the urban economy, the institutions of the state and public
interventions, resident and grass roots agency to build resilience and
anti-violence, and last but not least the arenas of political power and
contestation.
If we accept the notion of violent (urban) margins it is possible to see
that the logic of sovereignty dispute in the sense discussed above (Blom
Hansen & Steputtat, 2006) is based on localized access to key resources
by controlling relevant spaces and populations. This enables violent
actors such as gangs, drug traffickers and self-defence groups to be part
of the local and trans-local trade in illicit commodities, like drugs or
arms, but also facilitates them providing licit goods and services, jobs, or
even public investments. Imposing local regimes of ordering and rule,
backed by repertoires of violent enforcement and normative legitimization, is at the core of the constitution of territorial criminal
governance.
Urban territorial control by gangs and vigilantes relies on violence
and coercion towards resident populations. These must abide to the
imposed order but the stability and legitimacy of gang power also rests
of various forms of non-violent collaboration with and support from
residents and grass roots organizations. Support and legitimacy are
therefore the outcome of varying combinations of coercion, protection
and consent (Arias, 2017). Still, the essence of this type of criminal
governance is that, at the local level, criminal actors claim to impose
their specific normative order while monopolizing the means of violence
(Koonings, 2012). Small-scale gangs or gangs in early stages of development often claim a role as protector of their barrio given that their
members originate in the neighbourhood and nurture close family and
peer ties there. In addition, the material and social rewards that come
with joining a gang are hard to resist. In the gangs of Rio de Janeiro’s
favelas even the most menial occupation held by an adolescent yield
considerably more than the legal minimum wage. For Colombian
youngsters, a job in one of the many urban armed groups is as good a
career option as anything in the informal economy. Being a gang
member also brings important non-material benefits such as power,
enhanced status and sometimes a certain degree of prestige and popularity. Gangs thus offer alternative or perverse spaces for social inclusion
in the fractured cities of Latin America (see also Lemaitre Ripoll &
Restrepo Saldarriaga, 2019).
Maras (youth gangs) in Central America and Mexico are relatively
local initiatives. At the local level they extort smallholders, taxi drivers,
bus chauffeurs, and commercial entrepreneurs. But in the national
capitals of Guatemala City, San Salvador and Tegucigalpa they levy ‘war
taxes’ and confront the metropolitan police (Van der Borgh & Savenije,
2019). Direct political infiltration by such youth gangs is, as far as we
know, not existent. Still, gangs in, for instance, Rio de Janeiro and San
Salvador have occasionally tried to put pressure on politicians and citizens by making threats during elections. Larger and more powerful
gangs rather operate as employers towards local youngsters and
furthermore use their coercive capacity to influence or control local
associational life and to build clientelist relationships with outside actors such as politicians. This has been thoroughly studied for the case of
Rio de Janeiro where gang control of bairro politics developed since the
late 1980s (Arias, 2006; McCann, 2014).
Sao ˜ Paulo’s criminal faction Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC)
arguably offers the most notable example of territorial consolidation of
criminal governance in the sense that the PCC appears as a quasi-state
including rules and structures for the administration of ‘legitimate
violence’ and justice (Feltran, 2018). Similarly, the gangs of Rio de
Janeiro and many other Latin American cities uphold informal and
unwritten rules for controlling petty crime in the favela, disciplining
residents (discouraging them to become a ‘X9’ or snitch) or settling civil
and domestic disputes (Arias & Davis Rodríguez, 2006). The case of the
PCC is particularly instructive because the ‘Brotherhood’ as they call
themselves has developed and put into practise an elaborate repertoire
of normative directions and rulings (called salves), regulations
(including written ones) and procedures for arbitration and penal justice
in Sao ˜ Paulo’s urban margins (Biondi, 2018). Rather than seeing the PCC
as a parallel power we can understand this arrangement, called by
Denyer Willis (2015) the ‘killing consensus’ between police and PCC, as
a form of implicit co-governance, sometimes interrupted by violent
confrontations between the PCC and the state.
State-gang interaction, mediated by civil society, may be seen as
criminal co-governance aimed at urban pacification. The youth gangs
(maras) in Central America may not have wielded enough power to
carve out systematic connections with formal politics. Yet, in specific
K. Koonings and D. Kruijt

5
instances, they did mobilise a certain measure of respect, as in the case of
San Salvador where, although in prison, the gang leaders were invited to
the negotiating table to obtain a truce (Van der Borgh & Savenije, 2019).
Truces were also and repeatedly organised by successive mayors of
Medellín, often brokered by the Roman Catholic Church, NGOs, or international monitoring missions (Guti´errez Sanín & Jaramillo, 2004).
Also organised crime is inclined to settlements and informal, unspoken
pacts. In the case of Ciudad Juarez, ´ a brokered truce between two
rivalling cartels contributed to a relative calm in this border city that for
a decade was known as one of the Mexican killing fields (Wolff, 2018).
However, pacification based on gang truces proved to be a politically
controversial and fragile arrangement. Jamaica’s capital, Kingston, is
home to a particular arrangement of territorialized state-crime co-governance. Crime lords, called ‘dons’ operate at the same time as legal
entrepreneurs and employers, charismatic neighbourhood leaders, and
as vote-bank mobilizers in uneasy arrangements with party politicians.
This arrangement did not, however, prevent the violent arrest and
extradition of ‘star don’ Christopher “Dudus” Coke in 2010 (Jaffe,
2013).
All these manifestations of violent fracturing of Latin American
cityscapes work as a powerful amplifications of ‘cultural geographies of
fear’ alluded to above. The perception of violence and danger translate
into omnipresent aspects of everyday urban life that transcend social
classes and status groups and travels across the boundaries of the urban
landscape (Borde & Hernandez- ´ Avila, ´ 2022). As such it moves beyond
territoriality to become a key ingredient for what Holston (2008) calls
differentiated citizenship: exclusion from the substance of citizenship
suffered by the residents of the urban margins versus protective and
other privileges for the well-to-do beyond the law. This resonates with
broader debates on the political economy and political geography of
cities in which inequality, rights, and citizenship are emerging through
struggles for the reproduction of urban space (Lefebvre, 1991). In this
sense, violence in Latin American cities stigmatizes urban space through
penalizing the poor and deepening urban relegation (Wacquant, 2003,
2008).
The consequences for order making of these layered sovereignty and
co-governance schemes are not to be found in engaging directly with the
rules and laws of the state. Rather, these violent and criminal groups
enact a criminal customary law (like the lei da favela in Rio or the salves
in S˜
ao Paulo). In most cases gang and cartel rules echo the tropes of the
legal state, both in substance and performativity. Often, these rules are
pragmatically tolerated by the legal state in the urban margins. For this
reason, we suggest that this mechanism of criminal governance generates territorialized forms of fractured order and layered rulemaking.
6. State transgression
The third mechanism we highlight here, state transgression, refers to
state agents ignoring, breaking, or subverting the rule of law. We include
here (1) counterinsurgency and violent law enforcement, often using
extra-legal violence brokers like vigilantes, militias, or other non-state
extensions; (2) state agents involved in illicit ventures through connections with organized crime; and (3) the use of systematic political
violence to ensure regime survival. Let’s briefly look at each of these
three modalities.
The continuation of armed conflict under formal democratic rule
proved conducive to criminal governance within counterinsurgency
strategies. The armed conflicts in democratic or democratizing
Colombia (1964-present) set the stage for the involvement of state security forces (including police) in the widespread victimization of noncombatant populations and violation of human rights. The involvement of the military in ‘extra-legal victimization’ has been documented
for the Trujillo massacre, between 1988 and 1994, Operation Orion in
Medellín in 2002, and in the infamous case of the falsos positivos, the
deceitful presentation of civilians killed by the military as FARC combatants (NCHM, 2016). In a similar vein, repressive policing is a form of
criminal governance that transforms cities in zones of counterinsurgency warfare. After the progressive crumbling of pacification policing
in Rio de Janeiro and the federal military intervention in this federal
state’s public security sector in 2018, both paramilitary milícias and drug
trafficking factions are retaking control of the city’s margins (Hirata
et al., 2021: 12 ff.; Hutta, 2022; Israel de Souza, 2018). In fact, with the
rise to power of the radical right wing politician Jair Bolsonaro in 2018,
punitive populism and transgressive notions of law enforcement have
acquired increased electoral momentum and popular legitimacy (Salem
& Bertelsen, 2020). Bolsonaro’s political clan has subsequently faced
legal investigation for, among other things, ties with Rio de Janeiro’s
milícias.
The transgression of state agents into the realm of crime is without
doubt a worldwide phenomenon (see, for instance, on Russia, Galeotti,
2018; Belton, 2020). In the case of Latin America, recent manifestations
cover a wide spectrum, from police engaging in petty urban crime,
smuggling, kidnapping, or extortion (Dewey, 2012; Penglase, 2009),
and politicians of all ranks and stripes being involved in money laundering and corruption, to state agents facilitating or even coordinating
large scale organized crime. Mexico’s protracted drugs-related violence
has offered many examples, from the federal state assuming de facto
coordination of the cartels during the pre-2000 rule of the PRI to
regional or local authorities and public security forces doubling as
criminal operators (Astorga, 2004; Nagle, 2010; Pansters, 2018). In
Guatemala, politicians and public authorities routinely sustain relations
of corruption and complicity with drug trafficking organization
(Brockett, 2019). Military involvement in criminal ventures in
Guatemala also extends to other areas such as fraud and theft in the ports
and custom service (Schwartz, 2021).
Maduro’s Venezuela (next to Ortega’s Nicaragua) is the textbook
case where a deepening crisis brings state transgression to the level of
regime survival. Chavez ´ ’ reform programme had largely been financed
by extremely high oil revenues. But around his death in 2013 the oil
prices plummeted and by the end of 2013 Venezuela’s economic growth
became negative and inflation became rampant to morph by the end of
2017 in hyperinflation. Crime proliferated. Already under Chavez ´ but
even more under Maduro crime and victimization deteriorated
(Briceno-Le ˜ on, ´ Camardiel, & Perdomo, 2019). In response the Venezuelan state militarized law enforcement and mobilized informal extensions in the violent urban peripheries in the form of hybrid political
brigades-cum-localized gangs. According to Gan Galavís, 2020, these
brigades and colectivos are subordinated to the military and play a role in
the transformation of law enforcement into the repression of social and
political opponents. The influence of the army, already important during
the government of Ch´
avez, significantly increased under Maduro. In
2018 there were more than 700 generals and flag officers according to
military spokespersons. They function as the extended right arm
(defence) and left arm (public administration and repression) of the
president. Military commanders directly control 50 percent of the
budget and oversee all spending and supervisory offices, from the Court
of Auditors and Customs to entire chains of food distribution and imported articles. The higher echelons are strongly represented in the
cabinet, the public sector and all strategic companies (Kruijt, 2020). Oil
giant PDVSA (providing 90 to 95 percent of foreign currency) and other
state-owned enterprises that are essential for food distribution among
the poor - the hard core of the presidential electorate - are managed by
corruption (Tablante & Tarre, M., 2015: 260–278). Beyond administrative corruption, it is commonly understood that various state agents
are directly involved in the illicit trafficking of drugs and gold.
State transgression as mechanism of criminal governance converges
in all three fields of violent law enforcement, illicit endeavors, and
regime survival in a general climate of what Gan Galavís (2020) sees as a
rule of law crisis that includes the informal outsourcing of law
enforcement to non-state, extralegal and private actors, a crisis that
Corrales (2015) labels “autocratic legalism”. The implications of state
transgression for rules and laws more generally are twofold: state

agencies stretch or transgress the boundaries of the rule of law and
citizenship rights formally upheld by the legal state and the body of law,
leading to official unprotection of citizens through the necropolitics of
the War on Crime; and state agencies or public individuals criminalize
by venturing into criminal activities. Convergence of these transgressive
strategies of ‘state criminal governance’ into an agenda for regime survival through autocratic legalism and hybrid violence seems only a
matter of time, as is suggested by the cases of Venezuela and Nicaragua,
and (at the time of writing, November 2022) explored by Bolsonaro’s
ambivalent flirtations with on the one hand Rio de Janeiro’s milícias and
on the other hand political violence and military intervention. This
flirtation erupted, in a deeply polarized Brazil after Lula’s electoral
victory, in the assault on the federal institutions in Brasília on 8 January
2023..
7. Conclusions
It is tempting to sum up our conclusions in one sentence: informal low
intensity conflict in violent democracies breeds hybrid order and hybrid rules
and laws. In this paper we argued that this is not only the result of the
recent wave of criminal, social, and political violence paradoxically
emerging from the region’s ‘third wave’ (Yashar, 2018) transitory democracies, but also the reflection of a longer history of state-making that
has been entangled with particularism, hybridity, and violence. Criminal governance, in this perspective, is the twenty-first century iteration
of violent politics that straddles the uncertain ridge between constitutional legal states and democracy on the one hand and the permanent
exceptionalities of power, privilege, and coercion on the other.
We argued that contemporary violence in Latin America can be
considered as protracted conflict despite the differences from more
explicit scenarios of political armed conflict in other parts of the world
or, for that matter, the region’s own (recent) past. Latin American
violence after 1990 has many of the trappings of protracted conflict in its
morphology, agency, and impact ‘on the ground’. The singular difference, we suggested, is that this variety of protracted conflict is reproduced in an ‘uneasy’, unpeaceful coexistence with formal rule of law and
formal democracy, in a region that is formally ‘at peace’ and has been
building a century-old affinity with principles such as the rule of law,
constitutionalism, and national citizenship. This is the bedrock of the
hybridization of order making evident in the three mechanisms of
criminal governance that we explored in this paper. The implications for
rules and laws are the transmutation of public legality through its
continuous intersection with criminal rules which emanate from a
combined logic of coercion and legitimation.
This reflection in turn inspires thinking about solutions. Rules and
laws are as important, or maybe even more important, for order making
than open violence and coercion to back up the interests and agendas of
armed actors. But in Latin America there is hardly any role for autonomous rulemaking by non- or pseudo-states armed groups based on
specific doctrinal (ideological, ethnic, religious) principles. Rather,
there is a kind of dance macabre in which the rules, norms, and performances of the legal state are captured, amended, complemented, or
transgressed, by various intersections of extra-legal and criminal power.
These intersections permeate the edifice of public law and public institutions but do not fundamentally challenge or replace it. In public
consciousness and discourse, law is still law, and crime is still crime in
Latin America. But it is less evident who is the politician, the criminal,
the judge, or the police officer.
We think this is one of the reasons why public distrust of public institutions, such as governments, parliaments, political parties, the police, or the judiciary, is consistently quite low; only the armed forces
