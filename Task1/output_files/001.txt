Due
to
the
specific
nature
of
its
temporal
projection
(i.e.
the
fact
it
only
applies
in
times
of
armed
conflict),
international
humanitarian
law
creates
a
highly
selective
legal
lens
that
renders
very
different
human
experiences
visible,
to
those
that
are
made
visible
by
human
rights
law.
For
example,
unlike
human
rights
law,
international
humanitarian
law
does
not
generally
address
many
issues
taking
place
in
the
domestic
sphere,
relating
to
a
person’s
private
life,
family
relations
and
opinions
(Fortin,
2017,
pp.
58–59).
Unlike
human
rights
law,
international
humanitarian
law
follows
a
pragmatic
lesser-of-two-evils
logic
that
allows
actions
based
on
military
necessity
