It
is
due
to
the
profound
differences
in
the
projection
of
these
frameworks
that
the
rules
contained
by
both
bodies
of
law
sometimes
seem
to
be
in
conflict
with
each
other
as

It
is
also
probably
partly
due
to
enduring
deliberation
over
these
differences
that
the
legal
debate
about
(i)
whether
armed
groups
are
bound
by
human

law
and
(ii)
the
role
of
human
rights
law
in
these
spaces
is
ongoing.
