international
commitments
are
–
in
the
words
of
Eslava
–
“re-embodied
as
national
or
local”
via
legislation
or
law
(Eslava,
2014,
p.
41).
Yet
in
territory
under
the
control
of
armed
groups,
it
is
widely
understood
that
international
humanitarian
law
becomes
binding
upon
armed
non-State
group
without
the
need
for
implementing
legislation
(Fortin,
2017,
p.
188;
Kleffner,
2011,
pp.
446–448;
Murray,
2016,
p.
112).
As
a
result,
the
vertical
obligations
of
an
armed
group
vis-a-vis
`
the
population
under
the
group’s
control
in
international
humanitarian
law
are,
at
least
in
theory,
capable
of
having
a
direct
effect
on
the
lived
