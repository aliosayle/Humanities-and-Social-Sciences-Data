been
undertaken
on
the
knowledge
that
armed
groups
have
of
humanitarian
norms
(Bellal
et
al.,
2022)
and
the
different
actors
that
affect
their
compliance
(Considerations
and
Guidance
for
the
Humanitarian
Engagement
with
Religious
Leaders,
2023).
Additionally
it
is
important
to
make
sure
that
individuals
living
in
the
territory
are
aware
of
its
basic
provisions,
especially
those
which
are
relevant
to
their
safety
and
protection.
It
is
unsettling
to
read
a
report
that
was
published
in
2015
and
was
intended
to
bring
a
people’s
perspective
to
debates
regarding
the
meaning
of
the
term
‘directly
participating
in
hostilities’.
