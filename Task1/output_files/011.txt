in
Armed
Conflict
(CIVIC)
carried
out
250
interviews
with
people
who
had
lived
through
conflicts
in
Gaza,
Bosnia,
Libya,
and
Somalia,
asking
them
about
civilian
involvement
in
armed
conflict.
Its
findings
showed
that
many
civilians
were
generally
quite
unaware
of
what
actions
would
cause
them
to
forfeit
their
civilian
immunity
and
allow
them
to
be
targeted.
Conducted
interviews
revealed
many
different
interpretations
of
the
concept
of
‘civilian
protection’
that
varied
not
only
by
conflict,
but
also
by
interviewee
(CIVIC,
2015).
The
report
highlights
the
danger
of
civilians
existing
in
a
legal
universe
that
allows
them
to
be
identified
as
target-able
