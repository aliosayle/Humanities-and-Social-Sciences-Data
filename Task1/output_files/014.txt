(of

kind)
is
nevertheless
required
for
particular
norms
of
international
humanitarian
law
to
be
adhered
to
by
an
armed
group.
This
is
because
international
norms
on
particular
issues
implicitly
refer
to
domestic
law,
therefore
making
it
an
integral
layer
of
the
international
legal
framework.
This
interrelatedness
â€“
which
is
well
captured
by
the
concept
of
interlegality
-
is
particularly
vividly
seen
on
issues
of
detention
and
fair
trial,
where
international
humanitarian
law
requires
an
appraisal
of
domestic
law
for
a
determination
of
whether
trials
are
fair
(nullum
crimen
sine
lege)
or
whether
detention
is
arbitrary
