no
armed
conflict,
so
international
humanitarian
law
does
not
apply.
It
may
be
easy
for
international
lawyers
to
declare
these
zones
out
of
international
humanitarian
law’s
reach
but
de
Sousa
Santos’s
theories
on
legal
cartography–
just
like
Merry
and
Coutin’s
scholarship
on
measuring
systems
(Merry
&
Coutin,
2014)
-
encourage
us
to
see
that
boundaries
contained
within
international
law
also
play
a
role
in
determining
the
shape,
form
and
character
of
what
is
on
the
other
side.
As
Johns
points
out
in
her
work
on
non-legality,
what
is
not-legal
is
often
a
central
structuring
device
of
international
law
and
thought
