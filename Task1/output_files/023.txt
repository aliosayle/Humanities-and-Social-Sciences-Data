ad
bellum
and
jus
in
bello
requires
IHL
lawyers
to
disregard
the
aims
of
the
fighting
parties,
beyond
considering
whether
a
conflict
fits
within
Article
1
(4)
of
API.
The
rules
on
State
responsibility
–
and
attribution
in
general
–
require
lawyers,
in
most
instances,
to
disregard
the
question
of
motive.
According
to
these
rules,
it
is
the
act
of
the
State
that
matters,
independent
of
its
intention
(Responsibility
of
States
for
Internationally
Wrongful
Acts,
2001,
Article
2,

of
commentary).
As
Marks
writes,
lawyers
"tend
to
be
deeply
interested
in
‘how’
questions
(not
to
mention
‘what’,
‘where’,
‘when’
