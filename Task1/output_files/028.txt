status.
As
a
result,
the
“everyday
experience”
was
essentially
“vacated
and
displaced”
by
the
committee,
in
favour
of
the
distanced,
high
altitude,
objective
account
created
by
technology
from
which
the
human
voice
was
erased
(Wilke,
2017,
p.
1054).
This
shows
that
there
are
multiple
forces
beyond
law
contributing
to
a
generalized
abstraction
of
these
spaces
and
underline
the
heightened
need
to
be
alert
to
this
development.
