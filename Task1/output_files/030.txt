invisible
others.
Assessing
the
extent
to
which
international
law
is
capable
of
penetrating
the
everyday
and
interacting
with
other
frameworks
(somewhat)
guards
against
studying
international
law
as
an
exterior
phenomenon
(Pearson,
2008,
p.
6),
removed
from
the
messiness
of
everyday
life.
Instead,
it
invites
and
encourages
a
study
of
how
and
when
international
law
connects
with
â€“
and
even
constitutes
-
everyday
life
and
human
existence
in
these
spaces.
Perhaps
most
importantly
it
warns
against
creating
a
classroom
or
field
of
scholarship
where
the
study
of
law
and
rules
becomes
so
technical,
that
it
seems
divorced
from
the
everyday
experiences
