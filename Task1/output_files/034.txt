neo-colonization.
The
resource
frontier
has
been
described
as
wild,
violent,
and
deregulated
(Li,
2010;
Tsing,
2005:
27–28).
However,
rather
than
lawless
and
unregulated,
ethnographic
research
reveals
governance
constellations
at
the
resource
frontier
to
be
“thick”
and
observes
a
“plurification”
of
regulatory
authorities,
albeit
an
uneven
and
patchy
one
(Cote

&
Korf,
2018;
Watts,
2018).
The
mining
frontier
thus
emerges
as
a
sociospatial
phenomenon
where
many
rules,
orders,
and
governance
regimes
collide
often
in
new
ways
(Larsen,
2015:
5;
Rasmussen
&
Lund,
2018:
387).
Frontiers
are
“complex
plural
constellations”
(von
Benda-Beckmann
&
Turner,
2018:
