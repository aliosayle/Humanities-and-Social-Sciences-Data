different
sets

laws

regulations
that
relate
to
different
actors

work
on
different
scales.
Resettlement
processes
in
particular
draw
on
national
laws,
international
standards
(which
I
regard
in
this
paper
as
a
form
of
“soft
law”),
and
corporate
policies
among
others.
Resettlement
processes
thus
form
an
example
of
a
practice
that
exists
in
the
context
of
regulatory
plurification
of
the
extractive
frontier.
In
Mozambique,
such
processes
unfold
in
a
context
that
is
already
characterized
by
multifaceted
modalities
of
governance
and
multiple
jurisdictions
and
involves
various
sets
of
governance
actors
(Obarrio,
2014).
