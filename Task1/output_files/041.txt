profession
that
is
also
referred
to
as
community
relations
officer
or
social
assessment
and
impact
manager.
Resettlement
officers
find
themselves
typically
in
relation
to
actors
with
divergent
interests,
such
as
mining
companies,
government
officials,
and
local
populations.
These
interests
also
reflect
in
how
resettlement
managers
relate
to
and
navigate
different
sets
of
laws
and
standards,
and
how
they
translate
these
into
plans
and
practices.
I
will
show
that
in
the
context
of
the
coal
mines
in
Tete,
the
hierarchies
of
laws
and
standards
are
not
fixed
and
that
their
implementation
depends
highly
on
the
nature
of
a
particular
coal
mining
