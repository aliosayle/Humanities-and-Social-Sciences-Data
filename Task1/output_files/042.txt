company
and
is
determined
by
the
reluctance
or
incapacity
of
the
state
to
enforce
laws.
In
this
context,
international
standards
and
voluntary
corporate
guidelines
often
result
as
more
important
points
of
reference
than
the
‘hard
laws’
of
the
state.
Resettlement
officers
are
at
the
forefront
of
implementing
resettlement
and
thus
in
choosing
directions
in
what
rules
and
laws
are
important
points
of
references
and
which
are
less
so.
By
focusing
on
resettlement
officers,
we
can
explore
one
of
the
ways
by
which
corporations
act
as
governing
actors
at
the
extractive
frontier.
