the
surroundings
of
coal
mines
in
Moatize,
a
district
in
Tete
province,
where
since
2011
large-scale
mining-induced
resettlements
took
place.
Given
that
coal
resources
in
Moatize
are
located
in
relatively
densely
populated
areas,
residents
needed
to
be
relocated
to
areas
away
from
the
mining
site
to
prevent
them
from
suffering
the
most
direct
and
harmful
effects
of
coal
mining.
The
research
included
interviews
with
resettlement
officers
of
various
extractive
companies
in
Mozambique.
I
accompanied
four
resettlement
officers
in
their
daily
work
in
Tete
and
Maputo,
and
I
participated
in
a
two-week
course
on
land
acquisition
and
resettlement
