Maputo
and
that
is
generally
followed
by
resettlement
officers.
In
addition,
I
conducted
fieldwork
in
different
resettlement
areas,
and
I
did
interviews
with
activists,
NGO
staff,
as
well
as
government
officials.
The
paper
is
structured
as
follows:
I
will
start
by
giving
an
overview
of
the
most
important
sets
of
laws
and
standards
related
to
resettlement
processes.
Subsequently,
I
will
introduce
the
resettlement
officers
and
the
context
of
Tete.
Then
I
will
provide
an
ethnographic
exploration
of
how
resettlement
officers
relate
to
different
sets
of
rules
and
laws
and
how
these
result
in
the
implementation
of
resettlement
processes.
