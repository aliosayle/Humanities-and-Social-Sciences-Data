laws,
and
standards
of
resettlement
The
plural
legal
constellations
that
shape
resettlement
processes
in
Mozambique
have
roots
in
colonialism
and
reflect
global
connections
shaped
by
multinational
companies
as
well
as
development
cooperation
and
human
rights
discourses
(von
Benda-Beckmann
&
Turner,
2018).
The
regulation
of
resettlement
processes
in
Mozambique
is
a
complex
meshwork
of
sets
of
standards
and
laws
that
work
on
different
scales
and
involve
different
actors.
For
the
sake
of
clarity,
in
this
paper
I
make
a
rough
three-way
division
between
1)
national
law
and
regulations,
2)
international
soft
law
related
to
corporations,
and
3)
human
rights
law.
