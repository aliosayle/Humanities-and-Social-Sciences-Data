will
now
briefly
introduce
these
three
sets
of
regulations.
First,
in
legal
terms,
one
could
say
resettlement
starts
with
eminent
domain
â€“
the
power
of
the
state
actor
to
take
private
property
for
public
use
under
certain
circumstances
in
the
name
of
national
interest
(Buur
et
al.,
2019).
The
constitution
of
Mozambique
states
that
people
have
the
right
to
equitable
compensation
for
expropriated
assets
and
the
right
to
a
new
and
equal
plot
of
land.
The
resettlement
process
is
thus
part
of
the
compensation
for
expropriation.
In
the
context
of
international
investment
projects,
the
government
of
Mozambique
plays
the
role
