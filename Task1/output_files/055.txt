brought
several
cases
to
court
in
Mozambique.
But
court
cases
have
dragged
on
and
have
not
resulted
in
additional
compensation
for
people
affected
by
resettlement
or
in
substantial
sanctions
for
mining
companies.
All
of
these
sets
of
hard
and
soft
laws
apply
to
the
resettlement
context
or,
one
could
argue,
should
apply.
Yet
these
sets
of
laws
are
differently
applied,
enforced,
and
understood
across
resettlement
projects
in
Mozambique.
To
understand
how
and
when
certain
sets
of
hard
or
soft
law
become
relevant
and
how
these
different
sets
relate
to
one
another,
I
will
zoom
in
on
the
work
of
resettlement
