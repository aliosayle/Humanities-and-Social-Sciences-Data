I
encountered
were
well
situated
to
navigate
between
different
social
realms,
and
to
employ
different
rules
and
“tacit
codes”
(Blundo
&
Olivier
de
Sardan,
2006).
These
included
different
sets
of
national
laws
and
company
standards,
but
also
the
less
formal
ways
of
engaging
with
for
example
government
officials.
These
navigations
of
resettlement
officers
were
however
constrained
by
the
nature
of
the
mining
company
and
global
and
local
developments
in
the
extractive
industry.
