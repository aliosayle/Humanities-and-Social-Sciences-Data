best,
internationally.
So,
we
were
really
working
well.”
In
Ibrahimo’s
view,
ICVL
compared
rather
poorly
to
Rio
Tinto
and
resulted
as
“complicated.”
As
ICVL
took
over
the
Benga
concession
in
2014,
coal
prices
were
very
low
and
soon
ICVL
paused
its
coal
production.
For
years,
the
community
relations
office
of
ICVL
did
not
receive
extra
funding,
the
salaries
of
Ibrahimo
and
other
Mozambican
employees
were
paid
but
frozen,
and
their
health
care
insurance
was
stopped.
The
resettlement
managers
discontinued
their
regular
visits
to
the
resettlement
area
of
Moatize
because
they
had
no
funding
to
fulfil
the
demands
of
the
residents.
