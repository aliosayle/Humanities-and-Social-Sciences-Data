example
resettlement
managers
argued
that
“bad”
resettlement
is
bad
for
business.
This
logic
is
repeated
in
scholarship
about
“soft”
security
measures
in
the
surroundings
of
extractive
companies
that
are
considered
to
be
part
of
the
business
practices
of
mining
companies
(e.g.,
Buur
&
Sumich,
2019;
Honke,
¨
2013).
In
addition,
the
business
case
for
good
community
relations
is
widely
used
in
the
resettlement
consultancy
literature
and
supported
by
World
Bank
and
donors’
hopes
that
resettlement
will
result
in
opportunities
for
sustainable
development
(Reddy
et
al.,
2015).
However,
companies
relate
in
different
ways
to
the
“sustainable
development”
paradigm
and
to
CSR
