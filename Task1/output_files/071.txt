it

to
address
misconduct
of
mining
companies
and
to
monitor

national
laws

regulations
were
followed.
These
expectations

resettlement
officers

they

of
mining
company
Vale
and
the
state
company

Ports
and
Railways
(Portes
e
Caminhos
de
Ferro
de
Mo√ßambique,
CFM).
The
Nacala
Corridor
project
was
