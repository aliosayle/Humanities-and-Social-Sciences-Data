bushland
was
populated
with
sporadic
villages
and
homesteads.
The
flag
of
Renamo
(the
National
Resistance
of
Mozambique,
Resistˆencia
Nacional
de
Moçambique),
an
armed
group
and
the
main
opposition
party
of
Mozambique,
was
flying
in
several
settlements.
This
was
a
remarkable
sight
as
open
support
of
for
Renamo
was
in
many
parts
of
Tete
considered
dangerous.
Between
2012
and
2016,
Renamo
combatants
and
government
security
forces
were
engaged
in
an
armed
conflict
which
mainly
impacted
central
Mozambique,
including
Moatize
district.
While
at
the
time
of
fieldwork
in
2017
hostilities
had
ended,
politically
the
relations
between
the
two
parties
were
very
tense.
