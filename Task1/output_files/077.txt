for
an
audit,
they
have
no
idea.
They
send
sociologists
that
just
come
from
university
and
who
have
no
idea
what
to
ask.
The
government
just
wants
to
know
something
when
they
need
money,
and
then
these
per
diems
come
in
handy.
From
the
perspective
of
these
resettlement
officers,
the
government
was
absent
and
failed
to
provide
for
the
local
populations
in
the
rural
parts
of
Moatize.
In
their
view,
government
officials
failed
in
controlling
or
auditing
the
mining
companies,
and
merely
profited
from
the
mining
companies
when
it
suited
them.
Per
diems
were
an
essential
means
for
resettlement
officers
