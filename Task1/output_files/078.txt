to
involve
government
actors,
however
not
in
a
meaningful
way.4
The
resettlement
officers
considered
their
work
with
the
comunidades,
including
the
compensation
offered
for
resettlement
and
the
community
projects
they
implemented,
to
be
solely
at
the
initiative
of
Vale
or
in
this
case
CNL.
Another
resettlement
officer
of
Vale
expressed
a
similar
analysis:
“The
norms
of
CSR
are
very
beautiful.
But
the
government
does
not
have
the
capacity
to
comply
with
this
law
[and]
to
call
on
the
companies
to
submit
their
CSR
plans.
This
you
cannot
leave
up
to
the
liberty
of
the
companies.
[…]
It
is
already
something
