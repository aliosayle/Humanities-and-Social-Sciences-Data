if
the
companies
[make
a
CSR
plan],
all
alone,
without
being
obliged
by
no
one,
if
they
remember
this.”5
This
resettlement
officer
painted
a
picture
of
an
absent
government
and
a
very
willing
company
that
complied
with
all
the
norms
and
did
even
more
than
was
demanded
of
them
by
national
law.
He
alludes
here
to
the
“soft
laws”
and
standard
settings
of
companies
and
international
bodies
such
as
the
EITI
that
introduce
voluntary
standards.
Compliance
with
such
standards
is
often
expected
from
investors,
shareholders,
and
other
actors.
In
such
a
context
international
standards
and
expectations
are
higher
than
domestic
