CSR
efforts
were
also
understood
in
terms

company
and
the
government.
During
our
trip
along
the
railway,
Marco
pointed
out
a
village
where

and
his
colleagues
planned
to
dig
three
boreholes.
“But
these
will
be
on
the
record
of
the
government.”
Why
is
the
government
not
drilling
the
boreholes
themselves?
I
asked.
Marco
answered
that
the
government
does
not
have
the
funds,
“so
we
do
it
for
them.”
He
shrugged,
to
him
this
was
one
of
the
several
ways
in
which
their
social

merged
with
the
interests
of
the
