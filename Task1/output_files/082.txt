for
six
years
in
the
mining
industry
and
observed
that
the
mining
companies
have
only
minimally
been
held
accountable
by
the
government
for
malpractices,
a
process
that
is
further
complicated
by
the
alleged
corruption
of
courts.
In
this
context,
following
regulations
and
standards
is
largely
up
to
individual
companies,
and,
as
we
will
see
in
the
next
section,
their
critics.
This
does
not
mean
that
resettlement
officers
do
not
engage
with
state
actors.
Yet
in
their
experience
these
engagements
were
not
shaped
by
the
laws
and
regulations
that
govern
project
inducted
resettlement.

in
on
the
everyday
practices
of
resettlement
