officers,
we
see
that
the
relationships
with
state
actors
were
shaped
by
relationships
of
exchange.
This
is
illustrated
for
instance
by
the
handing
out
of
per
diems
to
“technical
guys”
of
the
government.
While
the
Mozambican
government
at
some
level
can
be
considered
as
an
arbiter
that
sets
laws,
allocates
concessions,
and
approves
resettlement
plans,
among
other
things
(Bainton
&
Skrzypek,
2021;
Rigi,
2007),
resettlement
officers
operate
in
a
space
where
the
state
is
not
(perceived
as)
acting
as
a
regulatory
or
controlling
body.
Rather,
the
state-company
relationships
that
resettlement
officers
are
managing
are
shaped
by
dynamics
of
exchange
and
