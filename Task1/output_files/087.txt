the
freight
garage
wearing
my
sandals
as
people
were
obliged
to
wear
fortified

Marco
moved
his
attention
from
the
shovelling
man
to
the
surroundings.

pointed
out
the
trees
and
the
houses
adjacent
to
the
dry
port
of
Jindal

â€œThis
should
not
be
this
way.
But
there
is
no
one
who
says
anything.
The
government
does
not,
and
neither
does
civil
society.
I
do
not
understand
this.
They
[civil
society
organisations]
only
focus
their
attention
on
some
companies,
such
as
Vale.
They
never
say
anything
