a
name
to

not
need
reputation
damage.
A
company
like
Jindal
does
not
care.
If
we
would
do
the
same
things.
Our
gates
would
be
closed.
People
would
be
protesting.
But
Jindal

it
seems
like
no
one

Marco
referred
to
past
protests
of
reassentados
in
Moatize,

and

close
eye
on

Due
to
previous
malpractices
elsewhere
(Marshall,

been
closely

by
various
NGOs
and

organisations
in
Mozambique
(Human
Rights
Watch,
2013;
Lillywhite
et
al.,
2015)
