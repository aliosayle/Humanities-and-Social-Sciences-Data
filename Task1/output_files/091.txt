companies
could
do
as
they
pleased
and
get
away
with
this.
The
standards
that
NGOs
and
international
organisations
applied
when
assessing
the
human
rights
record
in
the
extractive
industry
thus
seem
to
differ
per
company
and
are
shaped
by
past
histories
and
the
nature
and
provenance
of
a
company
(Kirsch,
2014;
Salverda,
2019).6
Some
companies,
such
as
Vale,
may
go
beyond
national
law
and
standards
and
provide
more
resources
to
CSR
projects
or
resettlement
efforts
(see
also
Li,
2016).
Other
companies
seem
to
have
less
concerns
about
company
reputation,
such
as
Jindal.
Such
differences
directed
the
companiesâ€™
allocation
of
resources
