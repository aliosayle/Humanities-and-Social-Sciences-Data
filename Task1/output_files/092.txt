and
personnel
to
resettlement
processes
and
thus
influenced
the
daily
work
of
the
resettlement
officers,
including
the
extent
to
which
this
was
in
concurrence
with
the
soft
and
hard
laws
relating
to
resettlement.
In
2015,
Jindal
was
accused
by
civil
society
organisations
for
noncompliance
to
their
resettlement
plan.
About
300
households
had
been
waiting
for
six
years
for
resettlement,
while
the
company
enclosed
their
homes
within
the
fence
of
the
mine
and
started
mining
operations
in
their
vicinity.
The
court
acknowledged
the
non-compliance
of
the
company
and
ruled
in
favour
of
the
plaintiffs,
yet
there
was
no
further
action
taken
