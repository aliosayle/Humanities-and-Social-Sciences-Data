of
injustice
among
communities
claiming
adat
land.
In
recent
years,
such
communities
have
formed
customary
councils
and
security
groups
in
the
provinces
of
Kalimantan.
Suggestions
of
potential
violence
are
an
integral
element
of
the
ways
in
which
these
groups
bring
adat
claim
to
corporations.
The
article
argues
that
while
violence
is
illegal
and
adat
itself
a
weak
legal
ground,
national
law
and
corporate
strategies
fail
to
address
such
land
claims
in
an
adequate
manner.
