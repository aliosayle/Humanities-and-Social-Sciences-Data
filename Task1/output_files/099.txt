Indonesian
province
of
West
Kalimantan.1
They
came
to
pay
an
adat
(customary)
fine
for
mining
on
land
that,
according
to
local
custom,
belonged
to
some
of
these
villagers
from
whom
the
company
had
not
obtained
prior
permission
(Satria,
2021).
The
imposition
of
such
adat
fines
has
no
formal
standing
in
Indonesian
law:
there
hence
was
no
formal
obligation
for
PT
Laman
Mining
to
pay.
Yet
despite
lacking
such
a
legal
basis
such
fines
are
regularly
imposed
in
the
Kalimantese
provinces
by
communities
who
seek
payment
from
companies
for
what
they
deem
to
be
unauthorized
usage
of
adat
land
