and
PT
SAWA
raise
two
questions
that
are
central
to
this
paper.
Why,
if
adat
fines
lack
a
legal
basis,
would
a
company
pay
such
a
fine,
as
PT
Laman
Mining
did?
And
why
would
anyone
keep
up
such
a
legally
unsubstantiated
claim
for
well
over
a
decade,
as
is
the
case
in
Long
Bentuk?2
The
answers
consist
of
at
least
three
elements:
the
legal
basis
of
adat
land
claims
(if
not
of
adat
fines),
the
societal
legitimacy
and
mobilizing
potential
of
adat,
and
the
perceived
injustice
of
the
usage
of
such
land
by
corporations.
In
consequence
these
combined
elements
