Government
recognition
of
the
community
as
an
adat
village
would
strongly
substantiate
such
claims.
I
believe
that
neither
village
is
recognized
as
such,
but
unfortunately
I
was
unable
to
ascertain
the
current
status
of
either
village
at
the
present
time.
If
officially
recognized,
a
village
can
include
adat
in
its
village
regulations
and
so
include
customary
law
into
that
level
of
government.
