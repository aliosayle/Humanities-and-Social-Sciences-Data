and
independent
media.
As
part
of
these
developments,
considerable
administrative
authority
â€“including
the
authority
to
give
out
concessions
to
mining
and
plantation
companieswas
decentralized
from
the
national
level
of
government
to
that
of
the
provinces
and,
below
these,
to
that
of
the
districts
(kabupaten)
and
city
(kota)
governments.
In
the
Kalimantese
provinces
as
well
as
elsewhere
the
number
of
concessions
awarded
increased
dramatically.
With
various
levels
of
government
authorized
to
give
out
concessions
but
no
central
administration
of
these,
a
plot
of
land
could
be
the
subject
of
multiple
concessions
given
out
to
various
companies
by
different
levels
