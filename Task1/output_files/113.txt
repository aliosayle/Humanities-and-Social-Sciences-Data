of
government.
In
the
province
of
East
Kalimantan,
which
has
some
of
the
largest
plantation
and
mining
operations
in
the
country,
an
overlap
in
concessions
of
nearly
4,5
million
hectares
was
established
in
2019
(FEL
GM
2019).
In
the
past
few
years
legislation
has
been
developed
to
solve
such
overlaps,
yet
its
implementation
is
still
insufficient.
Nasir
et
al.
(2022),
found
that
multiple
conflicts
resulted
from
these
overlaps
between
multiple
constellations
of
companies,
communities
and
(regional)
governments.
Creating
such
overlaps
appears
to
have
been
a
conscious
strategy
for
companies
and
a
minor
concern
for
some
government
officials
involved.
