Adat
claims
to
land
and
other
natural
resources
are
tenacious
and
frequently
ingrained
with
a
notion
of
injustice.
Adat
rights
to
land,
proponents
claim,
existed
before
colonization
and
before
the
Indonesian
state
came
into
being.
They
have
been
repressed
since
colonial
times
but
form
a
substantive
and
authentic
source
of
norms
and
regulation
that
should
not
be
ignored.
These
rights,
they
argue,
go
back
to
the
original
Indonesian
society,
which
makes
denial
oppressive
to
the
Indonesians
