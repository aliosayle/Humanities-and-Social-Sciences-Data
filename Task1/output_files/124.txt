the
main
law
regulating
land
rights
up
to
the
present,
states
in
its
article
5
that
the
law
pertaining
to
the
land
is
adat
law,
but
in
article
3
that
communal
adat
rights
â€“which
is
the
most
common
form
of
adat
land
claims-must
be
exercised
in
accordance
with
national
interest
and
existing
law.
Furthermore,
in
article
6
it
is
stipulated
that
the
rights
to
land
should
have
a
social
function.
The
combined
meaning
of
articles
3
and
6
thus
is
that
(adat)
land
rights
might
be
superseded
by
interests
with
a
greater
benefit
to
society.
Particularly
during
the
New
Order
