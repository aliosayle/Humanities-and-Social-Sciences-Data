adat
law
community,
that
is,
a
community
still
adhering
to
its
own
adat
in
its
daily
life.
If
this
adat
community
then
is
found
to
engage
in
communal
land
usage
it
can
request
(with
endorsement
of
its
regional
government)
for
mapping
and
registration
of
tanah
ulayat
(communally
held
land)
by
the
National
Land
Agency.9
While
a
few
communities
managed
to
obtain
recognition
as
an
adat
community,
registration
of
communal
adat
land
has
so
far
hardly
taken
place
as
local
governments
appear
hesitant
to
arrange
for
what
is
essentially
a
release
of
land
from
their
authority
(see
Bakker,
2007;
Bedner,
2016).10
