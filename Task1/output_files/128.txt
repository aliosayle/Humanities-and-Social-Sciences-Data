claims
are
abandoned;
rather
they
are
substantiated
in
different
ways.
Adat
also
functions
as
an
influential
socio-cultural
identifier.
This
became
quite
clear
following
the
1998
regime
change
and
the
decentralization
of
administrative
authority
to
lower
levels
of
government.
With
provincial
governors,
regional
heads
and
parliaments
on
these
levels
directly
elected
by
the
constituencies
of
their
territories
rather
than
appointed
by
central
government,
connections
to
the
local
populations
became
relevant
factors.
Whereas
ethnic
and
cultural
differences
were
carefully
managed
as
non-issues
in
the
past,
they
became
relevant
factors
through
decentralization
and
local
elections
(see
Aspinall
&
Fealy,
2003).
