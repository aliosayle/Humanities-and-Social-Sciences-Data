brought
ethnicity
into
politics
as
a
rallying
factor.
Indigeneity
as
putra
daerah
(‘local
children’)
became
relevant
in
political
elections,
contrasting
such
candidates
and
their
followers
to
migrants
originating
from
elsewhere
in
the
archipelago
(see
Sakai,
2002).
Discourses
of
indigeneity
and
indigenous
rights
that
frequently
involve
notions
of
adat
land
have
become
successful
mobilizers
of
ethnic
groups
(see
Li,
2000;
Hauser-Schaublin,
¨
2013,
pp.
9–11).
This
also
raises
the
issue
of
adat
as
a
limiting
category
of
rights
that
excludes
other
Indonesians
from
rights
available
to
those
lucky
enough
to
be
born
into
an
adat
community
(see
Henley
&
Davidson,
2007).
