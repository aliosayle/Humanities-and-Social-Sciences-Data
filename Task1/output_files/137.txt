their
presence
not
as
part
of
the
protest,
but
as
keeping
order:
they
ensure
that
protesting
Dayak
keep
calm
and
no
such
violence
as
took
place
in
West
and
Central
Kalimantan
–for
which
the
current
image
of
Dayak
ensures
the
potential-will
occur.
Yet
to
non-Dayak
spectators
they
also
emanate
a
threat:
their
ethnic
and
militant
appearance
is
a
strong
reminder
of
exactly
that
capacity
and
their
organized
presence
suggests
that
the
group
is
able
to
operate
in
a
disciplined
way.
“As
long
as
they
wear
those
costumes,
there
is
no
need
to
worry’,
a
senior
police
official
explained
to
me
