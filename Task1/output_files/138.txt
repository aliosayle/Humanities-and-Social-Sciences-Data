in
2016,
‘If
they
get
up
to
violence,
it
will
occur
afterwards,
and
they
[the
perpetrators]
will
be
anonymous’.
In
terms
of
security
their
message
is
twofold:
the
wellbeing
of
protesters
or
such
adat
officials
as
might
be
present
is
ensured,
but
the
security
of
those
against
whom
the
protest
is
directed
is
put
into
question.
There
is
no
violence
now,
but
that
might
follow
if
rights
must
be
enforced.
An
example
of
the
collaboration
between
an
adat
council
and
an
ethnic
security
group
is
the
following
sequence
of
events
that
took
place
in
the
district
of
Paser
in
East
