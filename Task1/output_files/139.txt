Kalimantan
in
2005.
A
local
Dayak
farmer
maintained
that
part
of
his
family
lands
had
been
taken
in
use
by
a
plantation
company
a
decade
earlier,
without
their
consent
and
without
compensation
payments
being
made.
At
the
time
he
had
not
dared
to
protest,
knowing
that
the
political
regime
did
not
hold
with
such
complaints
and
fearing
a
violent
reaction
by
the
police.
Besides,
he
had
no
official
title
to
the
land
aside
from
his
adat
claim.
By
2005
the
establishment
of
a
Dayak
adat
council
in
the
nearby
city
of
Balikpapan
had
him
decide
to
ask
for
their
assistance.
