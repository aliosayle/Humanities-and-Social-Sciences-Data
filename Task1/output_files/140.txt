A
council
member
came
to
visit
and
established,
based
on
reports
from
neighbours
and
the
village’s
adat
head,
that
the
land
at
stake
indeed
was
locally
considered
to
belong
to
the
farmer’s
family.
The
council
member
considered
the
grounds
for
this
claim
and
agreed
that
they
were
legitimate
as
per
local
adat.
He
reported
his
findings
in
writing
and
addressed
these
to
the
plantation
company
with
a
request
for
a
return
of
the
lands
or,
if
this
was
not
possible,
payment
of
an
indemnification.
As
no
reply
was
received,
the
council
member
went
to
the
plantation
to
ask
after
their
