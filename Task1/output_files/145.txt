Tensions
leading
up
to
the
violence
entailed
more
than
land
issues
alone,
but
the
full
complexity
is
beyond
the
range
of
this
paper.
See
van
Klinken

When
I
wondered
whether
the
mandau
served
a
practical
or
martial
purpose
I
was
told
that
they
were
cultural
artefacts
part
of
the
group’s
attire.
I
asked
whether
they
would
not
be
experienced
as
intimidating
to
which
the
group’s
leader
answered
that
such
was
not
intended.
On
this
leader,
see
also
Bakker
(2021).
