point
of
notions
of
unjust
land
dispossession
and
a
unifying
and
mobilizing
factor
for
such
groups
as
maintain
to
have
it.
Like
the
jar,
its
value
is
not
in
its
immediate
usage
but
in
the
meaning
that
sits
behind
it.
In
Kalimantan
feelings
of
injustice
run
deep
and
go
back
decades,
causing
claimants
of
adat
land
to
have
little
confidence
in
official
law
as
a
forum
to
have
their
grievances
addressed.
Alternatives
such
as
offered
by
non-state,
ethnically
exclusive
and
potentially
violent
adat
organizations
are
problematic
from
a
democratic
and
rule
of
law
perspective,
but
they
do
address
the
grievances
