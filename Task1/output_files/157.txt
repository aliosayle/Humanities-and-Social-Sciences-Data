in
Latin
America
for
order

and
governance.
The
article
is
developed
as
follows.
As
a
starting
point
we
combine
two
concepts,
namely
protracted
hybrid
conflict
and
criminal
governance,
to
frame
the
paradox
of
violence
in
Latin
America.
This
paradox
rests
on
the
proposition
that
chronic
violence
coincides
with
formally
democratic
states
that
are,
in
a
conventional
sense,
not
at
war.
We
will
then
look
briefly
at
the
historical
context
of
violence,
state
and
hybrid
order
making
in
Latin
America.
Subsequently
we
will
explore
three
specific
and
intersecting
mechanisms
of
criminal
governance
in
Latin
America:
state
capture,
layered
micro-sovereignty,
