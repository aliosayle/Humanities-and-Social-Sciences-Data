war
frames
to
analyse
or
denounce
this
violence
is
commonplace.
Both
the
statistical
magnitude
and
lived
experiences
of
violence
in
many
urban
areas
and
in
specific
production
zones
and
trade
corridors
of
the
drugs
economy
in
Latin
America
resemble
violence
in
conflict-torn
cities,
regions,
and
countries
elsewhere.
Notions
such
as
‘war
on
crime’,
‘war
on
drugs’,
and
‘pacification’
are
widely
used
in
Latin
America.
Increasingly
this
criminal
and
urban
violence
has
been
addressed
by
a
securitized
and
militarized
doctrine
for
public
order
and
law
enforcement
that
resonates
with
the
post-911
discourse
of
the
‘war
on
terror’
(Müller
&
Hochmüller,
2017).
