In
turn,
the
debate
on
conflict
resolution,
peacebuilding,
and
reconstruction
lacks
a
clear
perspective
on
how
to
relate
standard
peacebuilding
formats
to
the
hybrid
violence
in
such
protracted
urban
conflicts
not
just
in
Latin
America
but
across
the
globe
(Turkmani,
2022).
Still,
there
are
significant
differences
between
the
Latin
American
violence
and
other,
more
conventional
forms
of
protracted
hybrid
conflict.
The
most
important
divergence
lies
in
the
articulation
of
Latin
American
violence
with
relatively
consolidated
and
formally
democratic
states.
This
has
profound
consequences
for
order
making
that
cannot
simply
be
reduced
to
the
often-mentioned
fragility
of
the
rule
of
law
