democracies.
Therefore,
to
unravel
the
hybrid
entanglement
of
violent
crime
and
legal
governance
within
this
type
of
protracted
conflict
we
will
use
the
notion
of
criminal
governance
which
we
see
as
a
specific
elaboration
of
Arias
and
Goldstein’s
(2010)
concept
of
‘violent

We
understand
criminal
governance
to
be
the
exercise
of
power
or
the
ability
to
govern
for
illicit
objectives
(partly)
outside
of
the
legalbureaucratic-democratic
frame
of
the
modern
state
or
by
corrupting
or
transgressing
the
latter’s
institutional
boundaries.
