not
only
rests
on
the
appropriation
and
application
of
the
means
of
coercion
beyond
the
legal
state
monopoly
but
also
on
the
reconfiguration
of
rules
and
laws
as
a
strategy
of
order
making
and
legitimization.
Put
differently,
rules
and
laws
are
part
of
the
ordering
dimension
of
criminal
governance
both
in
terms
of
it
being
effective
(in
power,
resource
extraction,
disciplining)
and
‘legitimizable’
(in
the
sense
of
seeking
but
not
necessarily
obtaining
legitimacy).
This
notion
of
criminal
governance
resonates
with
debates
on
plural
or
hybrid
order
making
(Arias,
2017;
Arias
&
Davis
Rodríguez,
2006;
Dewey,
Míguez,
&
Saín,
2017).
