politics
and
state
institutions
are
influenced
or
controlled
by
agents
that
have
a
criminal
or
coercive
agenda;
(2)
sovereignty
disputes
at
the
local
level
when
nonstate
armed
actors
establish
territorial
forms
of
control
in
a
setting
of
‘layered’
or
‘nested’
sovereignty;
(3)
state
transgression,
meaning
state
agents
and
institutions
that
engage
in
extra-legal
economic
and
political
forms
of
conduct.
We
will
suggest
that
these
mechanisms
of
violent
order
making
invoke
peculiar
sets
of
rules
and
laws,
respectively
dubbed
quasi-legality,
layered
rulemaking
and
legal
transgression.
But
before
we
go
into
this
typology,
we
will
briefly
sketch
the
historical
and
sociopolitical
context
