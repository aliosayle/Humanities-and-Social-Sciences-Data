type
of
the
legal
nation-state.
Rather
we
seek
to
understand
the
endemic
and
historically
grounded
entanglements
of
the
legal
state
(that
is
often
quite
strong
or
at
least
big)
and
extra-legal
actors
as
co-producers
of
violence.
A

entry
point
is
provided
by
the
history
of
state-making
in
Latin
America.
In
all
but
a
few
Latin
American
states
(notable
exceptions
often
mentioned
are
Chile,
Costa
Rica
and
Uruguay)
this
history
generated
cycles
of
elitist
and
authoritarian
rule,
personalism
and
patrimonialism
as
tools
of
the
political
trade,
and
limited
and
contested
institutionalization
of
politics
and
public
policy.
