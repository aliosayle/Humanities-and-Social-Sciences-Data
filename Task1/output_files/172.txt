dualism
that
is
implicit
in
the
formal/informal
dichotomy.
Formal
rules
and
institutions
(including
forms
of
violence,
as
in
public
law
enforcement)
may
at
the
same
time
serve
other
agendas
–
such
as
extortion
-
and
take
different
shapes
–
like
extrajudicial
executions.
The
inverse
is
also
the
case,
for
instance
in
situations
of
gang
or
vigilante
rule
in
cities
like
Kingston,
S˜
ao
Paulo
and
Rio
de
Janeiro
where
de
facto
control
of
extra-legal
armed
actors
impose
a
de
facto
legitimate
order
in
collusion
with
state
entities
and
politicians.
