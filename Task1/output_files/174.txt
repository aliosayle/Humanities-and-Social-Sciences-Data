environment
that
is
conducive
to
the
hybridization
of
law
under
violence
and
criminal
governance
in
recent
decades.
Hyper-legalism
and
the
proliferation
of
legal
professionalism
have
been
a
strategy
to
counterbalance
the
vulnerability
of
the
law,
legal
institutions,
and
legal
practice.
This
has
been
put
in
even
sharper
profile
by
the
current
wave
of
violence
in
‘democratic’
Latin
America:
Moriconi
(2018:
499)
concludes
that
the
“norm
of
legality
has
lost
its
moral
persuasive
power”
making
the
illegal
legitimate;
and
Schultze-Kraft,
Chinchilla,
and
Moriconi
(2018:
470)
speak
of
“crimilegal
orders”.
So,
criminal
governance
rests
on
coercive
violence
and
the
hybridization
of
rules
