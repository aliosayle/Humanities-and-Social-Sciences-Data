and
laws.
As
we
will
explore
in
more
detail
in
the
following
sections,
the
reconfiguration
of
order,
law
and
rules
under
violence
and
criminal
governance
rests
on
specific
problems
of
‘stateness’.
First,
the
limitations
of
state
capacity
produce
not
just
violent
and
fragmented
(‘transgressive’)
law
enforcement
as
such
but
what
M´endez,
O’Donnell
and
Pinheiro
(1999)
have
called
the
‘unrule
of
law’:
punitive
state
violence,
misapplication
of
legal
norms,
and
impunity,
especially
towards
the
excluded
sectors
of
society
that
figure
as
second-
or
third-class
citizens.
Second,
limitation
and
fragmentation
of
the
reach
of
state
institutions
and
the
interlocked
emergence
of
non-state
