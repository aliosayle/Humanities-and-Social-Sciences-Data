ways
in
which
violent
coercion
and
subjective
legitimacy
to
rule
territories

populations
can
be
combined

Third,
inequality
and
exclusion
both
underlie
and
are
reproduced
by
the
intersection
of
state
fragmentation,
violent
actors,
and
hybrid
sovereignty
(Jaffe,
2013).
Thus,
an
ecology
of
structural
violence
ensues
where
disjunctive
citizenship,
informal
livelihood,
vulnerability,
and
grey
spaces
reproduce,
normalize
and
lend
legitimacy
to
violence
as
an
acceptable
ordering
principle.
We
locate
our
three
types
of
criminal
governance
and
hybridized
order
making
in
this
environment
of
violent
democracy.
