played
out
in
specific
areas
(and
not
in
others).
Co-governance
between
criminal
actors,
violence
brokers,
and
politicians
is
often
connected
to
specific
territories.
As
a
result
the
impact
of
violence,
insecurity,
and
fear
on
urban
societies
and
spaces
of
the
drugs
economy
in
Latin
America
has
been
particularly
profound.
Many
cities
in
the
region
can
be
seen
as
‘fractured’.
In
many
of
these
areas
we
see
the
emergence
of
so-called
microsovereignties
in
which
non-state
armed
actors
seek
to
establish
governance
over
urban
areas
and
populations
that
is
not
only
based
on
coercion
and
fear
but
also
on
legitimation
and
consent
