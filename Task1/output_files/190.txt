The
socio-spatial
impact
of
violence
extends
beyond
the
urban
margins
affecting
sociality,
lived
experience
as
well
as
public
and
political
mobilization
at
the
level
of
entire
cities
and
even
countries
(Glebbeek
&
Koonings,
2016:

On
the
other
hand,
Latin
American
violence
is
not
only
circumscribed
in
terms

space.
The
notion
of
‘margins’
is
useful
to
understand
that
there
are
institutional
and
socio-cultural
dimensions
to
hybrid
violence
that
are
not
(only)
defined
in
a
territorial
sense
(Auyero,
Bourgois,
&
Scheper-Hughes,
2015).

is
little
doubt
that
urban
violence
predominantly
affects
‘marginal’
