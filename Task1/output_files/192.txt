it
is
possible
to
see
that
the
logic
of
sovereignty
dispute
in
the
sense
discussed
above
(Blom
Hansen
&
Steputtat,
2006)
is
based
on
localized
access
to
key
resources
by
controlling
relevant
spaces
and
populations.
This
enables
violent
actors
such
as
gangs,
drug
traffickers
and
self-defence
groups
to
be
part
of
the
local
and
trans-local
trade
in
illicit
commodities,
like
drugs
or
arms,
but
also
facilitates
them
providing
licit
goods
and
services,
jobs,
or
even
public
investments.
Imposing
local
regimes
of
ordering
and
rule,
backed
by
repertoires
of
violent
enforcement
and
normative
legitimization,
is
at
the
core
