constitution
of
territorial

governance.
Urban
territorial
control
by
gangs
and
vigilantes
relies
on
violence
and
coercion
towards
resident
populations.
These
must
abide

the
imposed

legitimacy
of
gang
power
also
rests
of
various
forms
of
non-violent
collaboration
with
and
support
from
residents
and
grass

organizations.
Support
and
legitimacy
are
therefore
the
outcome
of
varying
combinations
of
coercion,
protection
and
consent
(Arias,
2017).
Still,
the
essence
of
this
type
of
criminal
governance
is

the
local
level,
criminal
actors
claim
to
impose
their
specific
normative
order
