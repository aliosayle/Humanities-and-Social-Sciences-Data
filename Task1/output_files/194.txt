violence
(Koonings,
2012).
Small-scale
gangs
or
gangs
in
early
stages
of
development
often
claim
a
role
as
protector
of
their
barrio
given
that
their
members
originate
in
the
neighbourhood
and
nurture
close
family
and
peer
ties
there.
In
addition,
the
material
and
social
rewards
that
come
with
joining
a
gang
are
hard
to
resist.
In
the
gangs
of
Rio
de
Janeiroâ€™s
favelas
even
the
most
menial
occupation
held
by
an
adolescent
yield
considerably
more
than
the
legal
minimum
wage.
For
Colombian
youngsters,
a
job
in
one
of
the
many
urban
armed
groups
is
as
good
a
career
option
as
anything
